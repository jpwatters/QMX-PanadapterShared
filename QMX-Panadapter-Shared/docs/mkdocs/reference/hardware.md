- **RAM**: 2 MB SRAM + 28 MB PSRAM
- **Storage**: 16 MB flash (firmware + settings)
- **Display**: 5" IPS LCD, 720×1280 landscape (10-bit parallel)
- **Touch**: ST7121 or ST7123 capacitive (100 kHz I2C)
- **Audio**: I2S codec ES8388 (CW audio output)
- **WiFi**: C6 co-processor (WiFi 6 802.11ax)
- **USB**: USB 2.0 host (USB-A port) + USB 2.0 device (USB-C port)
- **Battery**: 2500 mAh Li-poly (~4 hours panadapter, ~6 hours idle)
- **RTC**: Epson RX8130CE + 70 mF supercap (30–40 h time retention)
- **Optional Keyboard**: M5Stack SKU A164 (STM32F030, I2C slave @ 0x6D)
- **Optional USB mouse** (v1.3.0): plug into the USB-A port — a cursor appears and clicks drive every control. *The mouse and the QMX cannot share the port: a USB hub doesn't help, because the ESP32-P4's USB host lacks the Transaction Translator a high-speed hub needs for full/low-speed devices. Use the mouse for setup, log review and manual reading with the radio unplugged.*

## QRP Labs QMX / QMX+

### CAT Commands (Reference)

| Command | Query | Set | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FA** | `FA;` -> `FA14074000;` | `FA14074000;` | Frequency (Hz) |
| **MD** | `MD;` -> `MD2;` | `MD2;` | Mode (1=LSB, 2=USB, 3=CW, 5=DiGi) |
| **FW** | `FW;` -> `FW2500;` | `FW2500;` | Filter width (Hz, SSB only) |
| **TX** | — | `TX;` | Key transmitter |
| **RX** | — | `RX;` | Release transmitter |
| **TA** | — | `TA14074000;` | Tune and key (FT8 burst) |
| **PC** | `PC;` -> `PC05.0;` | `PC05.0;` | Power (watts, query only) |
| **SW** | `SW;` -> `SW1.25;` | — | SWR (query while keyed) |
| **TM** | `TM;` -> `TM123000;` | — | Time (hhmmss, query only) |
| **VN** | `VN;` -> `VN1_03_002QMX;` | — | Firmware version (query only) |

### SSB Filter Control (Special)

The QMX menu-manager controls SSB filter via:

- **`MMSSB|Filter RX=<hz>;`** — commit filter (persists)
- **`MMSSB|Bandwidth=<hz>;`** — apply live filter
- Both must be set to the same value for a clean change

## Cables

### Tab5 <- QMX (USB Audio + CAT)

- **Type**: USB-A (Tab5 host) -> USB-C (QMX)
- **Data lines**: Required (not charge-only)
- **Power**: Carries 5 V to QMX (optional; QMX can be separately powered)
- **Cable quality**: 3 m or less recommended (signal integrity)

### Tab5 <- Power

- **Type**: USB-C, 5 V DC
- **Current**: 2 A minimum (Tab5 draws ~2.5 A at full brightness + FT8 TX)
- **Source**: USB power adapter, power bank, or solar panel

## Frequency Ranges

Band coverage depends on which radio you have:

- **QMX+** — full **160 m through 6 m** coverage.
- **QMX** — ships in fixed band-group builds (for example 80/60/40/30/20 m, or 60/40/30/20/17/15 m, or 20/17/15/12/10 m). A given QMX only covers the bands it was built for, not the whole range below.

The panadapter works on whichever bands your radio supports:

| Band | Frequency | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **160 m** | 1.8–2.0 MHz | QMX+ only |
| **80 m** | 3.5–3.8 MHz | — |
| **60 m** | ~5.3–5.4 MHz | Channelised in many regions |
| **40 m** | 7.0–7.3 MHz | — |
| **30 m** | 10.1–10.15 MHz | SSB not available (CW/DiGi only) |
| **20 m** | 14.0–14.35 MHz | Most FT8 activity |
| **17 m** | 18.068–18.168 MHz | — |
| **15 m** | 21.0–21.45 MHz | — |
| **12 m** | 24.89–24.99 MHz | — |
| **10 m** | 28.0–29.7 MHz | — |
| **6 m** | 50–54 MHz | QMX+ only |

The Tab5 panadapter shows roughly a **48 kHz span** (±24 kHz around the VFO) by default, narrowing as you zoom in. This is the full bandwidth of the QMX's 48 kHz IQ audio stream over USB.

## Power Consumption

### Tab5 (estimated)

| State | Current | Duration (2500 mAh) |
|---|---|---|
| **Idle** (display off) | ~50 mA | 50 h |
| **Panadapter** (RX only, display on) | ~600 mA | 4 h |
| **FT8 RX** (decoding, display on) | ~700 mA | 3.5 h |
| **FT8 TX** (5 W burst) | ~1.5 A | 1.5 h (peak) |
| **WiFi + RX** | ~800 mA | 3 h |

### QMX / QMX+

| State | Current | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Receive** | ~80 mA | At 12 V |
| **Transmit** (5 W) | ~0.7 A @ 12 V<br>~1.0–1.1 A @ 9 V | A lower supply voltage draws more current for the same RF output |

Running both devices in the field: a Tab5 (2500 mAh internal) plus a small external battery for the QMX gives roughly 2–3 hours of active FT8 operation — the Tab5's display and CPU dominate the total draw, not the radio.

### RF Power Output

Both the QMX and QMX+ are **5 W-class** transmitters delivering roughly **3–5 W**, depending on band and supply voltage:

- Output is highest (~5 W) on the lower bands and tapers off toward the higher bands.
- The radio is built and tuned for either a **9 V** or **12 V** supply. Typical figures from QRP Labs: QMX ≈ 4–5 W at 9 V or 3–5 W at 12 V; QMX+ ≈ 3–5 W on either supply.

Both radios are the same 5 W power class — the QMX+ differs by covering more bands (full 160 m–6 m), not by transmitting more power.

## Antennas

The QMX/QMX+ uses a **50 Ω coaxial antenna connector** (SMA or BNC depending on model).

Recommended antennas:
- **Dipole** (1/2 wave) — best all-round performance
- **EFHW** (end-fed half-wave) — portable, single-wire
- **Vertical** (1/4 wave + radials) — omnidirectional
- **Magnetic loop** (small, tuned) — RFI rejection, low noise

Both are 5 W-class radios (≈3–5 W — see [RF Power Output](#rf-power-output) above) — a good antenna and low SWR matter at these QRP power levels.
