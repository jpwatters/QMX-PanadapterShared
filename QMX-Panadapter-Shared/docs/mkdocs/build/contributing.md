# Contributing & Feedback

Thank you for your interest in the QMX Panadapter!

## A Note on Code Contributions

This is a **solo project**. For now, all coding is done by the author (Steffen Lav, OZ1LAV), at his own pace, to keep the design coherent and moving in one direction.

**Pull requests / outside code contributions are not being accepted at this time.** This isn't about the quality of anyone's work — it's a deliberate choice to keep the codebase single-handed while the project is still finding its shape. It may change as things mature; if so, this page will be updated.

Please **don't open a pull request** — it will be politely declined. But please **do** send feedback (see below) — that's genuinely valuable and shapes what gets built next.

## Feedback Is Very Welcome

The best way to help right now is to **use it and tell me how it goes**:

- 🐛 **Bug reports** — something broke, behaved oddly, or crashed
- 💡 **Feature requests & ideas** — what would make it better for your operating
- 📋 **Field reports** — what worked (and what didn't) on your hardware, band, and setup

Send any of these to:

- **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SteffenLav/qmx-panadapter/issues)**
- **[QRPLabs Groups.io thread](https://groups.io/g/QRPLabs/topic/119565643)**

### What Makes a Good Bug Report

1. Your hardware (Tab5 model, QMX/QMX+ firmware version)
2. Your app version — shown in the Tab5's bottom status bar, and in the diagnostic log's own header
3. Steps to reproduce (exact sequence)
4. What you expected vs. what happened
5. **The diagnostic log.** There is nothing to switch on — logging is always running. Reproduce the problem, then in the web UI take **Files -> Diagnostic download ↓**. It gives you two files: the current session, and a copy that survives a reboot, which is the one that matters if the device restarted. The header identifies the firmware, the radio and the reset reason, so the log is self-describing.

## Building & Modifying for Yourself

The project is **[MIT-licensed](https://github.com/SteffenLav/qmx-panadapter/blob/main/LICENSE)** — you're free to build, flash, fork, and modify your own copy however you like. The "not accepting contributions" policy above is only about merging changes back into *this* repository; what you do with your own fork is entirely up to you.

If you want to build from source for your own use, see **[Build from Source](build.md)** and the **[Architecture Overview](architecture.md)**.

## Areas I'm Working On

Curious where the project is headed? The long-term direction lives in the **[ROADMAP](https://github.com/SteffenLav/qmx-panadapter/blob/main/README.md#roadmap)**. Current focus areas include FT8/FT4 TX soak testing, LoTW upload, and the native-portrait FPS rewrite. Feature requests that line up with that direction are especially welcome.
