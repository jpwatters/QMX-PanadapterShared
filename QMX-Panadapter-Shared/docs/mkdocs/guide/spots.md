# Live Spots

Live spots put other stations **on your spectrum**, at the frequency they are
actually operating on, so you can see who is where without leaving the radio.

Two sources feed the same display:

| Source | What it tells you | Default |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **POTA** (Parks On The Air) | Park activations currently spotted, any mode | **On** |
| **RBN** (Reverse Beacon Network) | CW stations the skimmer network is hearing right now | **Off** (opt-in) |

Both need WiFi. Nothing here transmits, and nothing here touches the radio until
you tap a spot.

### 1. What you see

Spots are drawn **over the spectrum**, the way a FlexRadio or similar SDR shows
them — the callsign sits around the middle of the spectrum with a thin vertical
line dropping from it down to the frequency axis, so the line points at the
frequency the station is on. The line is only 2 px wide, so the trace stays
readable underneath.

**Colour tells you what a spot means:**

| Colour | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Amber** | A POTA activation |
| **Bright green** | An RBN (CW skimmer) spot |
| **Grey** | You have **already worked this station on this band** |

Grey is the useful one: it answers "do I need this station?" at a glance. It is
band-aware, so the same operator on a different band is *not* greyed out — that
is a new band-slot.

**Spots fade as they age.** A spot is a claim about *now*, and an old one pointing
at an empty frequency is worse than no spot at all:

- Under 5 minutes old — full brightness
- Around 15 minutes — about half faded
- 30 minutes — gone

The callsign and its line always fade together.

**Off-screen counts.** When there are spots on your band that fall outside the
window you are looking at, a small count appears in the bottom corner of the
spectrum — `< spots (3)` on the low side, `spots (5) >` on the high side. It says
"spots" in words rather than a bare `<3`, because a lone number against the edge
of the spectrum tells you neither what it counts nor that you can tap it. These
are **scoped to the band you are on**, so the arrow never points at something on
40 m while you are on 20 m. Each is coloured like the spot it will take you to.

**Crowded bands.** Only so many callsigns fit legibly side by side, so on a busy
segment the closest-spaced spots lose their name — and a spot with no name is not
drawn at all, rather than leaving a line pointing at nothing. Stations you have
**not** worked are labelled in preference to ones you have, and fresher spots in
preference to older ones.

### 2. Tapping a spot

**Tap a callsign** and the radio tunes to it *and* switches mode:

| Spot mode | Radio goes to |
|-----------|---------------|
| CW | CW |
| FT8, FT4, other data | DiGi |
| SSB | USB above 10 MHz, LSB below |
| Unknown | Frequency only — the mode is left alone |

Bandwidth is deliberately **not** forced. The QMX keeps a filter per mode and
loads it when the mode changes, so the right width follows by itself.

**Tap an off-screen count** (`< spots (3)` / `spots (5) >`) and you jump to the nearest spot on
that side, which brings it into view. Those counts have a deliberately large
touch area — the visible text is small, but the target around it is not.

Tapping the spectrum anywhere else still tunes normally, and pinch-zoom and the
one-finger pan are unaffected. Only the callsigns themselves and the two counts
are spot targets.

**A callsign's target is the text, and nothing above or below it.** That matters
because a long callsign is a wide label sitting over the trace, and a click inside
it goes to *that station* rather than to the frequency under your pointer. If a
signal you want is behind a label, aim at the same column higher or lower in the
spectrum and it tunes there normally.

In the browser, hovering a callsign shows you a marker at that station's real
frequency with its name, so you can see where the click will take you before you
commit. On the Tab5 the two gestures are already distinct: tuning to a point needs
a brief hold, while a callsign is a quick tap.

### 3. Turning it on and off

**Settings drawer** (swipe in from the right edge) — **Live spots** section:

| Control | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Live spots (POTA)** | On | The whole feature. Off leaves the spectrum completely clean |
| **Add RBN (CW skimmers)** | Off | Adds RBN as a second source. Needs your callsign set |
| **DX cluster spots** | Off | Human-typed spots — the only source of SSB activity. A second connection, so opt-in |
| **SOTA spots (summits)** | Off | Summit activations from spothole.app, a volunteer-run server. Opt-in for that reason |
| **Mode filter the spots** | **On** | Shows only spots you can work in the mode you are in |

Every one is saved and appears in the configuration file you can download and
restore from the web UI, under `[settings]`.

**About the mode filter**, since it is on by default and changes what you see: tapping
a spot sets the **mode** as well as the frequency, so an unfiltered lane can drop a CW
operator into FT8 without warning — which is exactly what happened to Michael KZ4LY,
and why this exists. With it on, changing mode changes which spots are on screen, and
the off-screen counts change with them. A spot whose mode is unknown is always shown,
so nothing is hidden on a guess. Switch it **off** and every spot is shown, with a
two-letter tag on the label (`CW`, `SB`, `FT`) telling you what tapping it will do —
deliberately absent when the filter is on, because then every spot is already your
mode.

The spots overlay belongs to the **Panadapter** page. It is not drawn on the FT8
screen.

### 4. About RBN

RBN is **off by default, on purpose.** It is a continuous global feed rather than
an occasional fetch, and it arrives over a persistent connection on the part of
this board that has historically been the most delicate. Off by default means it
can never affect anyone who has not asked for it.

If you do switch it on:

- **Your callsign is required.** The feed asks for one when connecting; it is how
  RBN attributes load, not a password. Set it under **Callsign & Grid**.
- **Only your current band is kept.** RBN reports the whole world, and the
  display can only show one band at a time, so spots outside the band you are on
  are discarded as they arrive. Changing band clears the picture and it refills
  within a few seconds.
- **Duplicates are merged.** The same CQ is typically reported by ten or more
  skimmers; you see one entry per station, at the best reported signal.
- **RBN spots** are held for up to **10 minutes** after any skimmer last heard
  them — shorter than the 30 minutes above, because an active caller is
  re-spotted every couple of minutes and silence means they have stopped.
- It is the **CW/RTTY** skimmer feed. RBN runs a separate FT8/FT4 feed that the
  panadapter deliberately does not subscribe to — you are already decoding those
  yourself, far better, from the antenna.

### 5. About the DX cluster — where phone spots come from

RBN cannot show you an SSB station. It is a network of **automated skimmers**,
and a skimmer decodes CW, RTTY, FT8 and FT4 — machine-readable modes. There is
no such thing as an SSB skimmer, because no machine can recognise a callsign
spoken into a microphone. So every phone station on the band is invisible to it.

A **DX cluster** is people typing. That is the whole difference, and it is why
this exists as a third source:

- **Phone spots** — SSB activity you cannot see any other way.
- **Park and summit references** — a human writes `POTA ES-2081` in the comment,
  so a cluster spot can also tag your chase in the log.
- **Everything else people bother to spot** — DX, contest activity, anything
  worth telling other operators about.

Switch it on with **DX cluster spots (phone)**, next to the other two sources in
the settings drawer, or from the web UI. Like RBN it is **off by default**: it is
a second continuous connection, and the same caution applies.

Things worth knowing:

- **Your callsign is required**, for the same reason as RBN — the node asks for
  one to identify the connection.
- **Only your current band is kept**, again like RBN.
- **Mode is worked out for you.** Most cluster spots carry no mode field at all.
  If the spotter typed one (`LSB`, `CW`, `FT8`) it is used; otherwise the
  frequency is looked up in your band plan — 14.020 is CW, 14.285 is phone. The
  same inference you would make reading the line yourself.
- **Skimmer spots relayed onto the cluster are ignored.** Some nodes forward RBN
  traffic; those entries would duplicate what RBN already gives you, so they are
  dropped rather than drawn twice.
- Spots are held for up to **15 minutes** — longer than RBN, because a human
  spot describes something slower-moving than a skimmer's automatic report.

!!! note "Not every node is equally busy"
    Cluster nodes vary enormously. In testing, one node produced two spots in
    four minutes while another produced seventy-five in fifteen. A quiet node
    looks exactly like a broken connection, so give it a few minutes before
    concluding anything.

### 6. About SOTA — summit activations

SOTA spots come from **[spothole.app](https://spothole.app)**, an aggregator run by
Ian Renton M0TRT, used with his permission. That is worth knowing because it shapes
how the Tab5 treats it:

- **Off by default**, so nobody polls somebody else's hobby server without choosing to.
- **Fetched once every two minutes**, which is plenty for activations that last an hour.
- **When it is unreachable, nothing happens.** The spots already on screen stay until
  they age out normally — no banner, no error, nothing to dismiss. A volunteer server
  being down for an afternoon is an ordinary state, not a fault in your radio.

Almost every SOTA spot carries a portable suffix — `EA2GM/P` rather than `EA2GM` —
because the operator is on a summit rather than at home. That is why the callsign
shown is the one that was spotted, exactly as spotted.

> **SOTA is nearly all CW and SSB.** Of a typical sample, none are in a digital mode.
> So a summit will rarely appear in your FT8 log; the value of the source is seeing
> where the activity is on the spectrum, and being able to tap it.

### 7. Refresh and timing

- POTA is fetched about **once a minute** — spot rates on that service change on
  that sort of timescale, and the fetch briefly pauses the web UI's spectrum
  stream so the two never compete for the link.
- RBN and the DX cluster arrive continuously and are merged into the display
  every **10 seconds**.
- Ageing is re-evaluated every second, so spots dim and disappear on their own
  even when nothing new arrives.

If spots never appear at all, check in this order: WiFi connected (bottom bar),
**Live spots** switched on, and — for RBN only — a callsign set.
