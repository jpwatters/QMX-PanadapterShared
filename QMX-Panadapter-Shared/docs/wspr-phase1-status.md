# WSPR Phase 1 — status

Companion to `docs/wspr-scope.md` and `docs/wspr-phase0-research.md`. This is
the protocol-layer slice of Phase 1: message packing, the K=32 convolutional
code, interleaving, and the Fano decoder — proven on the PC, no ESP deps, no
firmware touched yet.

## ⚠ Licensing incident and fix (2026-08-22) — read this first

Everything below this section describes work that happened in TWO passes:
an initial implementation that turned out to have a real licensing problem,
and a same-day clean-room rewrite that fixed it. Recording both, not just
the fixed end state, because the mistake and how it was caught are worth
keeping.

**What happened.** This repo is MIT-licensed. The initial WSPR protocol/FEC
implementation was built by reading (and in places directly porting)
several WSJT-X-family GitHub projects: WSJT-X's own `lib/wsprd/fano.c` and
`wsprd_utils.c`, plus `robertostling/wspr-tools` and `mike-hb/wsprcan` for
cross-checks and pack-side formulas. All four of those are **GPL v3**
(confirmed via each repo's GitHub license API, not assumed). A fifth
source, `JamesP6000/WsprryPi`, shows as **"Other/NOASSERTION"** - GitHub
hosting a repo does not itself grant a license, so an unclear license
grants no rights either. None of that was safe to fold into an MIT
project: `main/wspr_fano.c`'s Fano decoder was described in its own commit
message as "ported near-verbatim" from `fano.c`, and `main/wspr_proto.c`'s
unpack functions were "ported byte-identical" from `wsprd_utils.c` - both
literal admissions of copying GPL source structure, not just facts about
the protocol.

**How it was caught.** Continuing Phase 1 work (better soft-decision
metrics, understanding a real-signal decode failure), the natural next
step was K9AN's `metric_tables.c` - and before using it, checking where it
actually lived turned up the `wsprd.c` file right next to it carrying an
explicit `License: GNU GPL v3` header. That prompted checking this repo's
own `LICENSE` (MIT) and then, once the mismatch was obvious, going back
and checking every WSPR source used so far - which is how the already-
committed `fano.c` port and the pack-side sources turned out to be the
same problem, not just the one file about to be added.

**The fix — clean-room rewrite of everything sourced from those repos.**
- `main/wspr_fano.c`'s Fano decoder: rewritten from the algorithm's
  published 1963 rules (Fano's original paper predates WSJT-X by decades;
  independent descriptions exist in the Wikipedia "Sequential decoding"
  article and standard coding-theory course notes) using this module's own
  data layout (parallel `gamma[]`/`enc_state[]`/`stage[]` arrays with an
  explicit backtrack cascade) instead of Karn's `struct node` array-of-
  precomputed-branch-metrics design.
- `main/wspr_proto.c`'s callsign/grid/power packing: rewritten from the
  WSPR message SPECIFICATION (the standard-callsign template, the
  Maidenhead grid system - protocol/geographic facts, not copyrightable
  code) with pack and unpack sharing ONE symmetric bit-packing design
  instead of being two separately-authored halves the way the ported
  version was.
- `test/wspr_codec_harness.c`'s interleave cross-check: the "magic number"
  one-liner copied from `wsprcan` (itself GPL) was replaced with an
  independent, obviously-correct-by-inspection naive bit-reversal - it
  didn't even need to be sourced from anywhere, since 8-bit bit-reversal is
  a generic, widely-published technique, not a WSPR-specific fact.
- **What was kept, deliberately:** the 162-bit sync vector, the generator
  polynomials (`0xF2D05351`/`0xE4613C47`), and the general bit-width
  layout (28-bit call / 15-bit grid / 7-bit power / 31-bit flush). These
  are DATA - facts about how the WSPR protocol is defined, not anyone's
  creative expression - and copyright doesn't protect facts. Reading them
  from a GPL source to confirm they're correct is fine; copying that
  source's CODE is what wasn't.

**The rewrite caught two genuine bugs of its own**, both fixed and now
covered by the test suite:
1. The Fano decoder's threshold-loosening logic initially jumped back to
   the root on every loosening event instead of resuming at whatever depth
   got stuck - this passed single-symbol-error correction (162/162) but
   silently broke two-symbol-error correction (94/162, should be 162/162).
   Fixed by loosening in place, matching the algorithm's actual
   requirement (not just Karn's specific implementation of it).
2. The callsign unpacker's range-check used the wrong radix for the
   leading (most-significant) character - 36 instead of the correct 37
   (alnum values 0-35 plus 36 for "absent") - which rejected every
   valid callsign whose digit sits at position 1 (K1ABC, W1AW, G0UPL) while
   accepting ones at position 2 (OZ1LAV, VE3XYZ, 4X1XX) by coincidence.
   Caught immediately by the round-trip test.

**Verification that the rewrite is behaviorally correct, not just
differently-licensed:** all three existing test harnesses
(`wspr_codec_harness`, `wspr_decode_harness`, `wspr_synth_harness`) were
rerun after the rewrite and produce **identical results** to before -
same 11/11 codec round-trip cases, same 162/162 single- and two-symbol
error correction, and critically, **the same 5 real callsigns and
legitimate grid squares decoded from WSJT's real reference WAV** (W3HH/
EL89/30, WD4LHT/EL89/30, ND6P/DM04/30, W5BIT/EL09/17, KI7CI/DM09/37) and
the same 3 candidates correctly rejected. That real-world decode match is
the strongest evidence the rewrite's independently-derived bit-layout
formulas are actually correct, not just internally self-consistent - a
formula that only agreed with itself could still be wrong in a way that
happened to cancel out; one that keeps decoding real over-the-air signals
correctly has been checked against reality.

## What exists

- [main/wspr_proto.h](../main/wspr_proto.h) / `.c` — WSPR type-1 message
  pack/unpack (callsign + 4-char grid + power dBm <-> the 50-bit message).
  Clean-room implementation (see the licensing section above): pack and
  unpack share one symmetric bit-packing design, derived from the protocol
  specification rather than ported from any single source.
- [main/wspr_fano.h](../main/wspr_fano.h) / `.c` — the convolutional
  encoder, the interleave/deinterleave permutation, sync-vector combine,
  and the Fano sequential decoder. Clean-room implementation of Fano's
  published algorithm (see the licensing section above).
- [test/wspr_codec_harness.c](../test/wspr_codec_harness.c) — the proof.
  Build/run:
  ```
  gcc -O2 -Wall -I main -o wspr_codec_harness \
      test/wspr_codec_harness.c main/wspr_proto.c main/wspr_fano.c \
      -lm && ./wspr_codec_harness
  ```
  All 5 test groups pass (pack/unpack round-trip incl. edge cases, interleave
  self-consistency, full noiseless pipeline, single- and two-symbol-error
  correction — exhaustive over all 162 positions, not sampled — and input
  validation).

## Bugs the harness caught (this is the point of building it first)

1. **Power field was missing its `+64` offset** — packed messages decoded to
   a power 64 dB too low. Caught immediately by the round-trip test.
2. **Callsign digit-anchor search was ambiguous for prefix-digit calls**
   (e.g. `4X1XX`) — "find the first digit" anchored on the wrong digit and
   produced an invalid suffix. Fixed by requiring the anchor digit's suffix
   to be letters-only, matching the standard-callsign shape the message
   format actually requires.
3. **The naive hard-decision metric table (match=1/mismatch=0) failed to
   correct even single-symbol errors** (17/24 in initial testing) — a Fano
   metric needs a *negative* expected value for a wrong path, which a plain
   match/no-match table doesn't have. Fixed to match=1/mismatch=-3 (verified
   empirically against several candidates), which now corrects 100% of
   single- and two-symbol errors (exhaustive, 162/162 and 162/162) and
   degrades gracefully beyond the code's real correction radius (3+
   simultaneous errors: not 100%, which is expected, not a bug).
4. **CORRECTED (initially misdiagnosed, see the follow-up session below).**
   I pulled a closed-form bit-reversal formula from wsprcan's source to
   cross-verify the interleave permutation, compared it against `reverse8()`
   as a 64-bit value, saw total disagreement, and wrote it up as "the
   fetched constant is wrong, almost certainly a transcription error" — an
   accusation against the source I never actually verified by hand. The
   real bug was in my own comparison: wsprcan's code declares the result as
   `unsigned char j = (...) >> 32;`, an 8-bit truncation that matters - the
   untruncated 64-bit intermediate is garbage BY DESIGN, only the low byte
   is the answer. Truncated correctly, it matches `reverse8()` exactly for
   all 256 inputs. **The interleave permutation now has a genuine
   second-source cross-check** (`test_interleave_self_consistency()` in
   `wspr_codec_harness.c`), and it passes. Kept here instead of quietly
   fixed, because "the web source was wrong" was itself an unverified claim
   presented as fact - the lesson is to re-check a "this looks wrong"
   conclusion by hand before writing it down, not just to fix the bug.

## What's proven vs. what's still open

**Proven**, by a harness that links the real code (not a mirror of it):
- Message packing/unpacking is correct for 6-char and 5→6-char-padded and
  prefix-digit callsigns, all four grid corners, and power quantization
  including rounding edge cases.
- The convolutional encoder + interleaver + Fano decoder round-trip a
  message through the full 162-symbol channel representation with zero
  errors, and recover it correctly under 1- and 2-symbol errors.
- The decoder does not crash or hang on random noise (20-trial fuzz test,
  10000 cycles/bit budget) — though see the caveat below.

**Explicitly NOT proven yet** (next steps, in rough order):
- ~~Sync-vector interleave against a second independent source~~ — **done**,
  see the correction above and the follow-up session below.
- **False-decode rejection.** Fed pure random noise, the Fano decoder
  "succeeds" nearly every time (a WSPR type-1 message carries no CRC) — a
  real receiver needs a separate quality gate (sync-correlation score
  against the known sync vector, callsign/grid plausibility, or both)
  before trusting a decode. That gate lives with the sync-search work below,
  not in the codec layer tested here.
- **Real soft-decision metrics.** The hard 0/255 two-level table proves the
  decoder logic but is not what a real receiver would build — a proper
  table derived from an actual per-symbol SNR estimate (log-likelihood
  scale) is needed before this can decode a real weak signal, per
  `docs/wspr-phase0-research.md`'s original flag.
- **The DSP front end.** Nothing here touches real audio: deriving a soft
  per-symbol metric from 4-FSK correlation against captured IQ, finding the
  ~1.4648 Hz tone spacing and the transmission's start time within a
  ~110.6 s window, and validating against real WSPR WAV captures. This is
  still, per the scope doc, "probably the majority of the total effort" —
  today's work is the layer underneath it, not a shortcut past it.

## Update — audio-domain decode against a real WAV (same session, continued)

The "next steps" above are now partly done. Added:

- [main/wspr_decode.h](../main/wspr_decode.h) / `.c` — coarse frequency
  candidate detection (one FFT over the whole capture, scored by 4-tone
  comb energy) + per-candidate start-time search + hard-decision tone
  extraction + the three-check plausibility gate (message shape, legal
  power quantization, Fano cycle count).
- [test/wspr_decode_harness.c](../test/wspr_decode_harness.c) — downloads
  are not automated (see below), but the harness runs against
  `test/wav_reference/wspr/150426_0918.wav`, **WSJT's own official WSPR
  sample recording** (sourceforge.net/projects/wsjt/files/samples/WSPR/,
  120 s / 12000 Hz / 16-bit mono), tracked in git alongside the existing
  FT8 reference WAVs.

**Result: 5 of 8 detected candidates decode cleanly** to standard-format US
amateur callsigns (W3HH, WD4LHT, ND6P, W5BIT, KI7CI), each with a legal
WSPR power value and fast Fano convergence (82-102 cycles). The other 3 are
correctly rejected — including, notably, **the file's own strongest signal
by a 3x margin**, which is the interesting result: its huge cycle count
(49400, vs 82-102 for the clean ones) says the decoder had to fight for a
result it shouldn't trust, and the most likely explanation is the one
documented limitation this module doesn't yet handle — frequency drift
over the 110.6 s transmission. Not silently worked around; flagged in
`wspr_decode.h` and asserted in the harness (`3 rejected` is a checked
regression, not just a log line) so a future drift-compensation fix shows
up as "the reject count changed" rather than an unnoticed behavior shift.

There is no independently-published "ground truth" for what this specific
file decodes to — the corroboration is three independent signals agreeing
(real callsign shape, legal power, fast convergence) across 5 different
candidates, not a match against an authoritative answer key. That's real
evidence, not proof; documented as such in the harness's own header.

**Runtime note**: the initial version of the start-time search called
`cos()`/`sin()` inside the innermost sample loop and didn't finish a single
candidate in 2 minutes. Fixed by precomputing twiddle tables once per
candidate frequency (indexed by absolute sample position) so the search
itself is pure array-lookup multiply-adds — full 8-candidate run now takes
~15 s on a laptop.

## Update — interleave cross-check corrected (same session, continued)

Fixed the item flagged throughout this doc as "still open": the interleave
permutation now has a real second-source cross-check against wsprcan's
independent implementation, and it passes. The earlier write-up blamed a
web-fetch transcription error for a mismatch that was actually my own
comparison bug (missing an 8-bit truncation the source code does
explicitly) — corrected in place above rather than silently rewritten, see
item 4 under "Bugs the harness caught".

## Update — frequency drift tested as a hypothesis, NOT confirmed (same session)

Tried a linear drift search (±8 Hz total across the transmission, 0.5 Hz
steps, plus a small start-time nudge) around the rejected strong-signal
candidate (`f0=1500.933 Hz`, `dt=2048`), throwaway tool, not promoted into
`main/`. Result: the best-scoring drift (-1.0 Hz) raised the raw
sync-correlation score by ~21% (199846 → 241820), but the resulting decode
was a **different** implausible callsign (`NE7CCO`), an illegal power value
(54 dBm - not on the legal WSPR set either), and a **worse** cycle count
(256154, vs 49400 at zero drift) - the opposite of what a real fix should
do. A better sync score without a better decode, on a search that also
picked a different message than the baseline, is the signature of chasing
noise, not of correcting a real impairment.

**Conclusion: frequency drift is not confirmed as the explanation** for
this candidate. Could still be drift with a wrong model (linear-centered
may not match a real oscillator's warm-up curve) or too coarse a search,
but could equally be something this simple pipeline was never going to
decode - two overlapping signals near the same frequency, a birdie/local
carrier, or genuinely not a standard WSPR transmission. Not chasing this
further blindly; the honest state is "rejected, cause unconfirmed," and
the existing three-check gate is doing its job either way - it caught a
decode that shouldn't be trusted regardless of why.

## Update — synthetic multi-signal + sensitivity testing (same session, continued)

A second *real* WAV proved to be a dead end: WSJT's own official sample
archive genuinely only has one WSPR file (checked its manifest directly,
`contents_2.5.json` through `contents_3.1.json` - all identical, one
entry). Rather than keep searching indefinitely, pivoted to something
fully controllable: synthesize known-ground-truth WSPR signals (same
precedent as this project's FT8 self-test, which synthesizes real GFSK
audio and decodes it through the real pipeline) and run them through the
real `main/wspr_decode.c` - not a replacement for real-signal testing
(`test/wspr_decode_harness.c` still does that), a complementary check with
exact ground truth. New: `test/wspr_synth_harness.c`.

**Multi-signal separation: PASS.** Three simultaneous synthetic
signals (different callsigns, grids, powers, frequencies within the same
200 Hz sub-band, light AWGN) - all three correctly detected as separate
candidates and decoded correctly. This is real evidence the coarse
frequency-candidate detection genuinely separates overlapping signals,
not just an artifact of the one real file having well-separated ones.

**Sensitivity sweep: informative, and a real methodology bug caught along
the way.** First attempt reported a "dB SNR" figure using a naive wideband
amplitude/noise ratio, and found NO breaking point at all down to -20 dB in
that unit - every test point decoded identically. That result should have
been a red flag on its own (a decoder that never fails as signal shrinks
isn't real), and the actual cause was a miscalibrated unit: each symbol's
soft decision comes from an 8192-sample coherent DFT, which has real
processing gain (~39 dB) a wideband ratio doesn't account for. Fixed by
computing SNR properly in WSJT-X's own standard 2500 Hz reference
bandwidth (the unit published WSPR sensitivity figures use) and widening
the sweep range. Corrected result: **this hard-decision decoder works down
to about -22.7 dB SNR (2500 Hz ref) and fails by -25.2 dB** - roughly 3-5 dB
worse than real wsprd's published ~-28 to -31 dB, which is the right shape
of result: hard-decision decoding is expected to lose a few dB of coding
gain versus soft-decision, not perform identically to it. A number that
came out worse than the reference implementation, by a plausible margin,
for a well-understood reason, is a healthier result than one that looked
suspiciously perfect - which the first (wrong) unit did.

## Update — soft-decision metric attempted, NEGATIVE result, not shipped

Followed up on "real soft-decision metrics" (previously flagged as having
a measured ~3-5 dB cost vs. published wsprd numbers) with a from-scratch
Monte Carlo simulation: `test/wspr_metric_sim.c` simulates this decoder's
own channel statistic (the coherent-DFT tone-power difference D each
symbol reduces to) under AWGN at a chosen amplitude, and builds an
empirical log-likelihood-ratio metric table from the resulting
histograms - fully original, not derived from anyone's published table
(this was in fact what prompted checking K9AN's `metric_tables.c`'s
license in the first place, which is what surfaced the licensing problem
recorded near the top of this document).

**Result: negative, table not shipped.** A single fixed-scale table,
calibrated at one amplitude, decodes correctly only in a narrow band
around that calibration point and fails outside it - including at
STRONG signal (+6.8 dB SNR, where the existing crude hard-decision table
works trivially). Confirmed with two different scales and up to 250,000
trials each; not a statistics problem, a structural one. D scales
roughly with amplitude² (it's a power difference), so a signal several
times stronger than the calibration point saturates nearly every symbol
to byte 0 or 255, and the noisy low-sample-count table entries at those
extreme bins (visibly single-digit counts in the printed tables) get
trusted as if reliable. This is exactly why wsprd itself doesn't use one
fixed table - K9AN's `metric_tables.c` ships FOUR tables for different
Es/No points and selects between them.

The existing 2-level hard-decision table stays the shipped default: no
calibration fragility, and already measured at -22.7 dB sensitivity,
which this attempt did not beat. Real follow-up work, not done here:
either multiple tables selected by an estimated operating SNR (matching
wsprd's own approach, but built fresh rather than copied), or per-capture
normalization - deriving the quantization scale from the ACTUAL candidate
signal's own measured |D| distribution rather than a pre-baked constant.
`test/wspr_metric_sim.c` is kept as the tool to pick this up with, not
deleted, since the simulation methodology itself worked fine - only the
fixed-scale design choice didn't.

## Update — per-capture normalization: works great synthetically, REGRESSES real WAV, reverted

Picked up the "per-capture normalization" follow-up from above:
`test/wspr_metric_sim.c` rewritten to train a pooled table across 8
amplitudes (200,000 total trials), each batch normalized by its own
mean(|D|) before quantizing - and the self-check applies the identical
per-capture normalization at decode time (estimating scale from the
candidate's own 162 symbols, exactly as a real decode would).

**Synthetic result: dramatic.** Single-message sweep decoded correctly
from +10.3 dB down to -24.2 dB, first failure at -26.4 dB - about 2-3 dB
better than the -22.7 dB hard-decision baseline. Wired into
`main/wspr_decode.c` (`wspr_build_soft_metric_table()` +
`wspr_deinterleave_scores()`, new function, added to `wspr_fano.c`/`.h`
for carrying a soft score instead of a hard bit through the interleave
permutation).

**Real-world result: regression, reverted the same session.** Run against
the actual reference WAV, plausible decodes dropped from 5/8 to 1/8 - most
candidates that used to decode cleanly now either time out or converge on
garbage. Reverted `wspr_decode_candidate()` back to the hard-decision
table immediately; verified all three test suites (codec, real-WAV,
synthetic) pass again at the known-good baseline before moving on.

**Why this matters more than the numbers:** this is the textbook
"validated in simulation, fails in reality" trap, and it happened despite
a careful, methodical simulation approach. The likely cause: the
synthetic channel model is one or a few clean tones plus i.i.d. Gaussian
noise, and real captured audio apparently has enough else going on (other
in-band signals, non-ideal noise characteristics, whatever a 120-second
real HF recording actually contains) that a table tightly calibrated to
the clean synthetic statistic isn't robust to the mismatch - while the
simple hard-decision table, needing no calibration at all, doesn't have
that fragility.

**The standing rule this reinforces**: a synthetic sensitivity sweep
passing is evidence, not proof. The real WAV test is what actually
decides whether a decoder change is a genuine improvement, and it must be
run - and trusted over synthetic results when they disagree - before
anything is called a win. `wspr_build_soft_metric_table()` and
`test/wspr_metric_sim.c` are kept (real, working infrastructure, and the
synthetic-only validation gap is now a known, documented risk rather than
an invisible one) but NOT used by default. If picked up again: test
against the real WAV at every iteration, not just at the end, and
consider whether the synthetic channel model needs to include something
closer to real band conditions (multiple signals, real noise) rather than
assuming AWGN-only is representative.

## Update — RESOLVED: why the strongest real-signal candidate fails

Answered with a purpose-built diagnostic, `test/wspr_diag_candidate0.c`
(kept, not deleted - reusable for any future "why doesn't this candidate
decode" question). **Real ionospheric fading (QSB) within the 110 s
transmission - not a bug, not frequency drift (already tested and ruled
out), not a second overlapping signal.**

Three pieces of evidence, all from the diagnostic tool:

1. **Sync-bit match rate climbs from ~52-63% (near coin-flip) in the
   first ~55 s to 81-89% in the last ~55 s.** Uniform noise would sit flat
   near 50% throughout; a steady signal would sit flat near its own real
   confidence. A clear monotonic climb is fading, not noise or a decode
   artifact.
2. **Total 4-tone power rises ~20x from the first time-window to the
   last**, tracking the same shape - the signal was physically weak for
   roughly the first half of the transmission and strong for the second
   half. Textbook HF QSB.
3. **Scanning ±3 Hz around the candidate frequency shows ONE clean,
   single-humped power curve** - no second bump, definitively ruling out
   an overlapping second station sharing this frequency.

**Why the decoder can't recover it despite the real signal being
present:** roughly 46 of 162 symbols are wrong, mostly clustered in the
noisy first half - far beyond the code's measured ~2-symbol correction
capacity (`wspr_codec_harness.c`). The reason a real signal with real
information in it still can't be decoded is that BOTH metric tables tried
so far (hard, and the reverted per-capture soft table) give every symbol
the SAME confidence regardless of whether it came from the coin-flip-weak
first half or the crystal-clear second half. A per-capture-normalized
soft metric can't fix this - it corrects for the CAPTURE's overall
strength, not for strength varying WITHIN the capture.

**This reframes the next soft-metric attempt, if there is one.** The two
tried so far both used one global scale per capture. What this candidate
actually needs is PER-SYMBOL (or short-window) local confidence
weighting - e.g. scale each symbol's metric contribution by that symbol's
own measured power relative to a local neighborhood, so the decoder
naturally down-weights the noisy early symbols and trusts the strong late
ones, the way a real receiver's AGC-plus-soft-decision pipeline would.
That's a genuinely different mechanism from either previous attempt, not
just a retry with different numbers - worth trying before concluding soft
metrics don't help on real signals, since the real regression on the
OTHER (working) candidates last time might have been a separate synthetic-
model-mismatch problem, not evidence against per-symbol weighting
specifically.

## Update — per-symbol reliability weighting: built, validated, shipped as a fallback

Followed up directly on the fading finding above with a targeted (not
generic) mechanism: **per-symbol** confidence weighting, distinct from
both earlier soft-metric attempts which used one scale for the whole
capture. First checked prior art: the general technique ("optimum soft-
decision decoding with channel state information in the presence of
fading") is textbook, dating to a 1984 IEEE paper (Cain, Clark & Geist) -
not new. But `wsprd`'s own only metric-tuning knob (`-z`, a single global
bias) and its documented two-pass technique (successive interference
*cancellation*, for separating overlapping signals - a different problem)
show no evidence of genuine per-symbol/time-varying weighting for WSPR
specifically. Applying the known technique to this specific problem
looked like real, if modest, unexplored ground.

**Implementation**: `wspr_fano_decode_weighted()` (new, `main/wspr_fano.c`/
`.h`) lets the caller supply the branch metric directly per raw position
instead of going through a fixed `mettab[2][256]` lookup - a static table
has no way to express "this symbol's neighborhood was weak". Refactored
the search loop into a shared `fano_search()` so `wspr_fano_decode()` and
the new weighted variant can't drift apart in behavior.
`wspr_deinterleave_scores()` (new) carries a real-valued score, not just a
hard bit, through the same interleave permutation. `main/wspr_decode.c`'s
`try_weighted_decision()` computes a per-symbol reliability weight from a
smoothed local power envelope (window ~15 symbols / ~10 s, matching the
timescale `test/wspr_diag_candidate0.c` observed), normalized against the
capture's own median, clamped to [0.2, 3.0] - then scales BOTH the
informative part and a fixed per-symbol penalty by that weight, so a
low-reliability symbol's vote barely counts either way rather than
confidently voting wrong. Deliberately an analytic formula, not a trained
table - the per-capture soft-table attempt's regression was blamed on
overfitting a trained distribution to a synthetic channel model that
didn't match reality, so avoiding that shape of solution was itself part
of the design.

**Wired in as a FALLBACK, not a replacement**: `wspr_decode_candidate()`
tries hard-decision first; only if that's not plausible does it try
weighted. This means candidates hard-decision already handles correctly
cannot regress - confirmed, the real WAV still decodes the identical
5/8 candidates.

**This time, validated properly before trusting synthetic results** -
learning directly from the previous soft-metric regression:
- **Mechanism sanity** (`test/wspr_fading_harness.c` test 1): a uniform
  strong signal (no fading) still decodes correctly through the weighted
  path. Not broken by construction.
- **An early test run gave a false alarm worth recording**: the first
  attempt at a controlled "50%-match first half" synthetic test actually
  measured 100% match in that "weak" half (the chosen amplitude wasn't
  actually weak) - and on that not-actually-fading case, the weighted
  decoder gave a WRONG answer while hard-decision succeeded easily. That
  looked like a real bug at first. Recalibrating the amplitude (a small
  separate sweep) to genuinely reproduce the diagnosed ~57% match rate
  showed the mechanism was never broken - the initial test just wasn't
  testing what it was meant to.
- **Moderate fading, 10 seeds** (test 2): weighted decode is **10/10
  correct vs hard-decision's 9/10**, including one specific seed where
  hard-decision fails outright and weighted recovers it. A real,
  measurable, reproducible win.
- **Severe fading matching the real candidate's diagnosed pattern, 10
  seeds, WITH ORACLE (ground-truth) weighting** (test 3): **both
  hard-decision and weighted decoding fail 0/10** - even the best
  possible case for this mechanism (knowing exactly which symbols to
  trust, not just estimating it) cannot recover this severity. Swept
  weight levels from near-zero to 1.0 (i.e. no weighting at all) and every
  level converged on the same result. **Conclusion: not a bug, not a
  tuning gap - a genuine information-theoretic limit.** With ~55% of a
  162-symbol K=32 rate-1/2 codeword effectively erased, there isn't
  enough redundancy left to reconstruct 50 message bits, regardless of
  how well the decoder identifies which symbols to discount.

**So the answer to "why does the strongest real candidate fail" gets a
final coda**: fading explains it, per-symbol weighting is the
theoretically correct response to fading, and it was built, worked, and
still doesn't recover THIS candidate - because this candidate's fading is
simply too severe for any weighting scheme to fix. That is a complete,
non-contradictory story, not a loose end. The mechanism itself is real
value for less extreme cases and is shipped; `test/wspr_fading_harness.c`
keeps both results (the win and the honest limit) as permanent regression
tests, including a note that a FUTURE change making test 3 start passing
should be treated with suspicion (possible false-positive decode of
noise) rather than celebrated automatically.

### What's still open

- **Real soft-decision metrics (whole-capture, trained-table style)** —
  still not used; two attempts (fixed-scale, per-capture-normalized) both
  failed for reasons documented above. The per-symbol WEIGHTED approach
  (see the update directly above) is a different, working mechanism
  serving a related but distinct need - it doesn't replace the open
  question of whether a properly-calibrated whole-capture soft table could
  still help on top of it.
- **A second real WAV** — not found through the official channel; the
  synthetic multi-signal test above is the practical substitute for now.
- **Device integration (Phase 2)** — deliberately not started. Per the
  scope doc's own rule, real-signal validation was worth more than moving
  to firmware, and this session added several genuinely new pieces of
  evidence (multi-signal separation, a measured sensitivity number, a
  validated and shipped fading-recovery mechanism, and a complete,
  evidenced answer for why one specific real candidate can't be
  recovered) rather than just one WAV file's results.

## ⚠ Update 2026-08-24 — Phase 1 was proven as an ALGORITHM, never sized for the DEVICE

Everything above is still true and still passes. But every measurement in it was
taken on a laptop, and the first attempt to run this decoder on the ESP32-P4
failed instantly and completely. The feasibility probe that found it is
`main/wspr_selftest.c` (dev action `{"action":"wspr_selftest"}`), which
synthesizes a known transmission and pushes it through the real decoder on real
silicon - the WSPR analogue of `ft8_synth_and_decode()`.

First on-device run:

```
STAGE 1  find_candidates: 0 candidate(s) in 0 ms
RESULT: FAIL - 'W5BIT' 'EL09' 17 dBm was NOT recovered
```

Zero milliseconds for an FFT over 1.44 million samples is impossible, and the
only fast exit is a failed allocation. Three host-shaped assumptions, none of
which a PC would ever notice:

| | what it asked for | against |
|---|---|---|
| `build_twiddles()` - tables as long as the capture | **46.1 MB** | 14.7 MB free PSRAM |
| `wspr_find_candidates()` - one FFT over the whole capture | ~23 MB | 14.7 MB free PSRAM |
| three live `double tp[162][4]` arrays | ~18 KB of **stack** | 16 KB task stack |

All three are now fixed, and **every fix was verified behaviour-preserving
against the real reference WAV before it went anywhere near the device.**

**1. Twiddle tables: 46.1 MB → 262 KB, exactly.** The correlation keeps only the
magnitude of `sum x[idx]*e^(-j*w*idx)` over one symbol. Split the index into
`base + j` and the sum becomes `e^(-j*w*base) * sum x*e^(-j*w*j)`; the leading
factor has unit magnitude and cancels identically in `|.|^2`. So the tables only
ever need one symbol period, indexed by the local offset. Not an approximation -
the real-WAV regression came back with the **same five callsigns and the same
Fano cycle counts** (81/94/81/114/119), which is what proves the tone powers are
numerically identical rather than merely close enough to decode. It is also ~2x
faster (7.0 s vs ~15 s for the 8-candidate run) because an 8192-float table
stays in cache and a 1.44M one cannot, and marginally more accurate, since
`cos(w*i)` for i up to 1.44 million loses precision in argument reduction.

**2. Candidate search: one giant FFT → averaged periodogram, ~2 MB.** 50 %
overlapped windows of `16 * WSPR_SYM_LEN_SAMPLES = 131072`. The window length is
chosen, not arbitrary: a power-of-two multiple of the symbol length makes the
1.4648 Hz tone spacing land on **exactly 16 bins** with no rounding in the comb
at all. Frequency precision drops from 0.0083 Hz to 0.0916 Hz bins, i.e. 0.046 Hz
worst-case error, which is 0.03 of a cycle across a symbol - far inside the
~1.46 Hz sinc null. Real WAV: same five stations, same grids, same powers, still
exactly 3 rejects. Sensitivity sweep: **identical**, same -22.7 dB floor, same 81
cycles at every level.

**3. Stack: ~18 KB → ~8 KB.** Three `double tp[WSPR_NSYM][4]` arrays at 5184
bytes each, never live simultaneously, which the compiler was free to overlap and
did not - the device overflowed a 16 KB task stack by 1268 bytes. Hoisted to one.
This matters far more here than on a host: `xTaskCreate()` takes its stack from
**internal** RAM, and this board runs with roughly 40 KB of that free.

**A separate note on floats.** The self-test's own signal synthesis took **80
seconds** in double precision and **2.8 s** in float - 29x - because the P4's FPU
is single-precision only and every double `sin`/`log`/`cos` is software-emulated.
That was never inside the decode budget, but it is worth knowing before writing
any new DSP for this target: on this chip, `double` is not "float but safer", it
is a software library.

**Standing lesson, and the reason the gate existed:** a host harness proves the
ALGORITHM. It cannot prove the implementation fits the target, and on this board
memory - not CPU - was the wall. Measure on the device before building anything
on top.

### The timing answer: it decodes CORRECTLY on the P4, and it is 4.5x too slow

With the three memory fixes in, the self-test runs to completion on hardware:

```
synthesized 1440000 samples (120 s) in 2804 ms
STAGE 1  find_candidates: 8 candidate(s) in 9229 ms
  #0 f=1492.03  DECODED 'W5BIT' 'EL09' 17 dBm  dt=1.600s cycles=81  [67166 ms]
```

**Correctness is not in doubt.** The decoder recovered the exact message, the
`dt=1.600s` matches the 1.6 s start offset that was synthesized, and
`cycles=81` is **identical to the host's 81** - bit-level agreement between a
laptop and the P4, not merely "it decoded here too".

**Speed is the problem, and it is not marginal:**

| candidates | total | of a 120 s cycle |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | 546.6 s | **456 %** |
| 4 | 277.9 s | 232 % |
| 2 | 143.6 s | 120 % |

The device is **~78x slower than the laptop** on this path. Note that even
**two** candidates does not fit - so trimming the candidate list cannot rescue
it, and neither can narrowing the start-time search (worth ~4.7x on its own).

**Why, and therefore what the fix is.** Per candidate the start-time search runs
~119 `extract_tone_powers()` calls, each reading 162 symbols x 4 tones x 8192
samples ~ 5.3 M values - about 630 M reads per candidate, from a 2.88 MB buffer
that only fits in PSRAM. The inner loop is **memory-bound on PSRAM**, not
compute-bound, which is why a 360 MHz core lands 78x off a laptop rather than
the ~5-10x raw clock ratio would suggest.

So the fix is the one every real WSPR decoder already uses, `wsprd` included:
**mix each candidate down to complex baseband and decimate before correlating.**
WSPR occupies about 6 Hz; at a decimated 375 Hz a symbol is 256 samples instead
of 8192, so `extract_tone_powers()` drops from 5.3 M reads to ~166 K - a 32x cut
that should put eight candidates near 20 s, comfortably inside the cycle. The
mixing pass itself is one sweep of 1.44 M samples per candidate, negligible
against the 630 M it removes.

**Status: RX-on-device is BLOCKED on that front end.** Not on correctness, not on
memory any more, and not on anything the UI can work around - Phase 3 can be
built and looked at, but it will show an empty list until the decimating mixer
exists. That is now the top item for this branch.

### RESOLVED — the decimating front end, and RX now fits the cycle

Implemented the fix named above: mix each candidate to complex baseband and
decimate by 32 (12 kHz → 375 Hz) before correlating, so a symbol is 256 samples
instead of 8192 and `extract_tone_powers()` reads ~166 K values per call
instead of 5.3 M.

Measured on the device, same self-test, same synthesized signal:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| per candidate | 67,166 ms | **6,787 ms** |
| 8 candidates + search | 546 s | **64.1 s** |
| of a 120 s cycle | 456 % | **53.4 %** |
| host, full 8-candidate run | 6.90 s | **0.58 s** |

**And nothing was traded for it**, which is the part that needed checking rather
than assuming:

- Real reference WAV: the same five callsigns, grids and powers, still exactly
  3 rejects, and the decode **cycle counts are identical** (90/81/81/118/117).
- Sensitivity sweep: **identical** - same −22.7 dB floor, same 81 cycles at
  every level. Decimation cost nothing.
- On-device: `DECODED 'W5BIT' 'EL09' 17 dBm dt=1.600s cycles=81` - same message,
  the same recovered 1.6 s start offset, and the same 81 cycles the host gets.

Two implementation notes worth keeping:

- **The local oscillator is an incremental complex rotation, renormalised every
  1024 samples.** A `cosf`/`sinf` per sample would cost more than the work being
  saved, but an un-renormalised rotation drifts in magnitude - and the tail of a
  120 s capture being scaled differently from its head is exactly the kind of
  slow error that looks like fading and gets blamed on the ionosphere.
- **The search grid did not get coarser.** The coarse and fine steps are the
  same real-time intervals as before, expressed in decimated samples
  (8192/8 → 32, 8192/32 → 8).

**Stack**: the self-test task finished with 5196 bytes free of 32768, i.e. ~27.5
KB used - so the 32 KB PSRAM stack was not generous, it was necessary, and the
original 16 KB could never have worked.

**Remaining cost is now the candidate search**, 9.3 s of the 64 s, doing 21
FFTs of 131072 over PSRAM. Comfortable inside the budget and not worth
optimising until something else needs the room.
