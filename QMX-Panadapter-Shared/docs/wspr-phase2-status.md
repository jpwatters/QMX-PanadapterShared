# WSPR Phase 2 — the radio side, TX and RX

Companion to `wspr-phase1-status.md`, which covers the codec and decoder as
algorithms. This file covers the parts that touch the radio: `main/wspr_tx.c`
(building a transmission and driving it out as a timed CAT tone sequence) and
`main/wspr_rx.c` (capturing the even-minute window from the live IQ stream and
decoding it). Both have now worked on the air - see "ON THE AIR" for TX and
"RX ON THE AIR" for receive.

**This engine has now transmitted on the air and been decoded worldwide** — see
"ON THE AIR" below, the last section. Everything before that section was written
from **dry runs**, where `tx_cmd()` logs the command it would have sent and sends
nothing, and it is kept in that voice deliberately: the dry-run sections record
what could and could not be concluded *before* there was external evidence, which
is the more useful thing to be able to re-read.

`WSPR_TX_SEND_LIVE` still defaults to 0 in git and always has. Going on air is a
deliberate, supervised act, not a build-time default.

## First hardware run — 2026-08-23

Until this date the engine had compiled into real firmware and booted, but the
162-symbol burst had **never been observed running**. It has now run twice, end
to end, on the dev Tab5 (COM3), triggered by the dev action
`POST /api/cmd {"action":"wspr_tx_test"}`.

Structurally correct on the first attempt:

- **162 `TA<freq>;` commands**, one `TX;`, one `RX;` — the exact counts.
- **Four distinct tones**: 1500.00, 1501.46, 1502.93, 1504.39 Hz, i.e. the
  1500 Hz base plus 0/1/2/3 × 1.4648 Hz. The tone spacing is right on the wire,
  not just in the constant.
- **Fired on the even UTC minute**, from an arm ~63 s earlier.
- **Total 110.6 s** against the protocol's 110.592 s.
- The safety tail ran: key-up `TA0;` at t+110,590,848 µs, then `RX;` 4.9 ms
  later (the envelope settle), then `cat_poll_set_paused(false)` — the CAT poll
  heartbeat resumed 16 ms after the burst ended.
- USB audio never faltered: 47–49 k pairs/s throughout both bursts, with FT8
  capturing and decoding concurrently the whole time.

## The one real defect found: symbol timing under load

Measuring the per-symbol `[DRY RUN t+…us]` timestamps against the ideal
682,666.67 µs grid is the whole reason those timestamps are logged, and it
immediately found something a code reading would not have.

At the original `tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 1`, **15 of 162 symbols went out late — 7
of them by more than 30 ms, worst 66.4 ms.** Every late symbol coincided with
ordinary higher-priority work (`FT8 cap:`, `uac-host: RX xport:`); no errors, no
anomaly. It is plain priority starvation, the same one CLAUDE.md's #199 note
describes for the FT8 tasks: priority 1 sits below `fft_task` (4), `cat_poll`
and `cat_link` (5) and `audio_task` (6).

Raising the worker to **priority 5** fixed it. Controlled A/B, same firmware
otherwise, same concurrent FT8 load (224 decodes during the "after" burst vs
198 during the "before" one — if anything the fixed run was busier):

| | prio 1 | prio 5 |
|---|---|---|
| median error | −464 µs | −688 µs |
| p90 | +896 µs | −336 µs |
| **worst symbol** | **+66.4 ms** | **+9.0 ms** |
| symbols >10 ms late | 13 / 162 | 0 |
| symbols >30 ms late | 7 / 162 | 0 |

5 is deliberate, not "as high as possible": it puts the burst with the CAT
tasks, which is what it is, and stays strictly below `audio_task` (6) so the USB
isochronous pump keeps the margin whose loss cost 170–350 ms of audio per slot
in #51.

**The error never accumulated even before the fix** — mean measured period
682,606 µs against an ideal 682,667 — because `run_burst()` sleeps to absolute
`t0 + i × period` targets rather than adding delays. That is the design being
right; the priority was the part that was wrong.

The small residual −688 µs median is `pdMS_TO_TICKS()` truncating microseconds
to whole 1 ms ticks, so the task wakes up to 1 ms early. Harmless, and correctable
with a short busy-wait at the end of `sleep_until()` if it is ever worth it.

### A trap in reading the capture, worth keeping

The first pass at the "after" numbers came out as a median of exactly one symbol
period, which is nonsense of a very specific kind. The cause: the serial capture
had **dropped a single log line**, and the analysis was indexing symbols by row
number, so every symbol after the gap was compared against its neighbour's ideal
time. The firmware was fine — its own `WSPR TX [161/162]` progress marker and
`burst complete (110.6 s)` prove all 162 ran.

Two things came out of that and both are now the method: derive each symbol's
index from **its own timestamp** (`round(t / period)`), never from its position
in the file; and when a statistic lands suspiciously close to a system constant,
check the parse before believing the result.

## What the dry run does and does not prove

**Proven**: message → 162 symbols → correctly spaced tones → correctly timed
command sequence → clean key-up and release, under realistic concurrent load, on
real silicon and real scheduling.

**Not proven, and not provable this way**:
- That the QMX responds correctly to a `TA<freq>;` every 682 ms for 110 s. In a
  dry run **no CAT bytes are sent at all**, so nothing here exercises the radio,
  the CDC pipe, or the QMX's own tone-change latency. FT8 TX sends `TA` at a
  160 ms cadence and is on-air validated, so the mechanism is not in doubt — but
  the 110 s continuous key-down is a different duty cycle from FT8's ~12.6 s.
- That anyone can decode it. Only an on-air test with a WSPRnet spot proves the
  chain end to end.

Because the burst sends nothing, the **only** part of a dry run that needs a
radio at all is the arm-time Digi-mode confirmation.

## ON THE AIR — 2026-08-23, 21:28 UTC

First WSPR transmission from this firmware, supervised, one burst, operator
awake and watching the radio. `OZ1LAV JO65 37` on 14.09710 MHz (dial 14.0956 +
1500 Hz audio), 5 W.

**Decoded by 50 receiving stations**, from 913 km to 15,663 km:

| reporter | grid | SNR | km |
|---|---|---|---|
| VK5WA/2 | QG50nf | −19 | 15,663 |
| VK5ARG | PF95ht | −6 | 15,280 |
| WA2TP | FN30lu | −7 | 6,152 |
| EB5TC | IM99tk | −12 | 2,038 |
| F1ZNO | JN14sc | −8 | 1,431 |
| GW2HFR | IO83ib | −4 | 1,086 |
| G4HZX | IO91xk | −6 | 969 |
| HB9VQQ | JN47kh | −9 | 951 |
| G3VGZ | IO94im | −6 | 913 |
| …40 more | | | |

What each column independently confirms:

- **Grid `JO65` and power `+37 dBm`, identical on all 50 rows.** The message
  survived packing, convolutional encoding, interleaving, sync merge, tone
  mapping, 110.6 s of CAT stepping and the ionosphere, and came back bit-exact
  from 50 decoders that have never seen our code.
- **Frequency 14.097108–14.097111 MHz** against a predicted 14.09710 — within
  about 10 Hz, which is the QMX's own calibration, not ours.
- **Drift 0 on every single spot, no exceptions.** This is the result worth
  keeping. Drift is what a receiver measures when a transmitter wanders during
  the transmission, so 50 independent stations all reporting zero is external
  confirmation of the tone stepping AND the symbol timing under real RF - the
  thing a dry run structurally cannot prove.

Also cleared, since these were the open questions from the dry-run section
above: **zero `send failed`** across all 162 real CAT writes, the QMX accepted a
`TA<freq>;` every 682 ms for 110 s without complaint, the 110 s continuous
key-down completed with no thermal or SWR event, and the CAT poll heartbeat
resumed 2 ms after the burst. The `[n/162]` markers landed at 13,651–13,656 ms
per 20 symbols against an ideal 13,653.3, so the timing held with real blocking
CDC writes and not merely when logging.

⚠ **A live build loses the per-symbol telemetry.** `tx_cmd()` only logs its
`[DRY RUN t+…us]` line when `WSPR_TX_SEND_LIVE` is 0, so a live burst gives only
the every-20-symbols progress markers. Fine here - the external drift figure is
better evidence than our own timestamps could ever be - but if per-symbol timing
ever needs measuring *on air*, that logging has to be made unconditional first.

⚠ The build that transmitted was a **temporary local edit** of
`WSPR_TX_SEND_LIVE` to 1, reverted in the source immediately after flashing.
Nothing in git has ever had it set to 1, and going on air stays a deliberate,
supervised act rather than a build-time default.

## Start offset: WSPR begins one second INTO the even minute

Caught while preparing the on-air test, and it would have been invisible from
our side - we would have transmitted perfectly and simply been early.

`wspr_tx_seconds_until_next_slot()` targeted `sec_in_minute == 0`. The
convention is +1 s: 110.6 s of signal inside a 120 s window with the slack
mostly at the end.

Rather than take that from recollection, it was **measured against real
traffic**. The five stations in the reference WAV (recorded from the even
minute) start at:

| W5BIT | KI7CI | WD4LHT | W3HH | ND6P |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.109 s | 1.515 s | 1.621 s | 1.813 s | 2.133 s |

A clear floor at ~1.1 s with each station's own clock error stacked above it -
so the convention is real, and firing at `:00` would have put us ~1.6 s ahead of
the population every receiver searches around. `WSPR_TX_START_OFFSET_MS` (1000)
was added before the on-air test, and the 50 spots say the resulting alignment
is right.

The same reference WAV also independently confirmed that **37 dBm is a legal
WSPR power quantization** - KI7CI transmits at exactly that - so the power we
encoded was checked against real traffic rather than a remembered table.

## A dry run no longer needs a radio

`wspr_tx_arm()` refused to arm unless the QMX confirmed Digi mode. In a dry-run
build that check guards an action that cannot happen: `tx_cmd()` sends zero
bytes, so the burst cannot key anything or reach the radio at all.

Left strict it made the engine untestable exactly when bench time is cheapest.
This Tab5 wedges its QMX on **every** reflash (#74 - confirmed deterministic by
the operator: "it will never survive on its own"), so after any firmware change
there is no radio until someone power-cycles it by hand, and all the timing work
that needs neither radio nor antenna sat blocked behind that.

Now a dry-run build logs a warning and arms anyway when `cat_is_ready()` is
false. **A live build keeps the check unconditionally** - there it is the real
thing, the one that stops a burst going out in the wrong mode.

## RX ON THE AIR — 2026-08-24, VK3QN in Australia

The receive slot loop (`main/wspr_rx.c`) captures the even-minute window from
the live IQ stream and decodes it. First over-the-air reception:

```
DECODED 'VK3QN' 'QF22' 37 dBm  f=1516.85 Hz dt=0.47s cycles=104   (05:30 window)
DECODED 'VK3QN' 'QF22' 37 dBm  f=1517.03 Hz dt=1.09s cycles=94    (05:40 window)
```

QF22 is Victoria, Australia — **15,940 km at 81°**, which the device computed
from the operator's own grid, and filed straight through the spot store to
`/api/wspr` and the browser panel. Nothing synthetic anywhere in that chain.

**How it hooks in**: the DSP's FT8 capture chain (+12 kHz IF to DC, /4 to 12 kHz
mono, continuous pre-ring) is exactly what WSPR needs, so `UI_MODE_WSPR` joins
FT8 in one shared predicate rather than duplicating it. It takes **3**, not 2 —
the CW branch already owns 2.

⚠ **It decodes EVERY OTHER cycle, by construction.** A cycle is 120 s, the
capture fills all of it and the decode measures ~66 s, so one sequential task is
still busy when the next window opens. The fix is a second buffer and the
ping-pong `ft8_test.c` already uses. Left undone deliberately: a receiver that
works at half rate beats a concurrent one that is wrong.

### Two of my assumptions that measurement overturned

Recorded because both were confident, plausible, and wrong.

**"The spectrum freezes in WSPR mode."** Only half true, and the halves matter.
`dsp.c` skips the panadapter FFT while a CAPTURE IS ARMED, not for the whole
mode — and the web reads `dsp_get_spectrum()` on its own path regardless, so the
browser keeps moving throughout. What did freeze was the **Tab5**, because I had
also gated `render.c` on the mode. That gate is now reverted: measured, it buys
nothing (64.1–65.5 s decode with the panadapter rendering vs 65.7–66.1 s with it
gated off) and cost the operator a frozen screen within minutes of shipping.

**"The captured floats are ±32768, so a straight cast is fine."** They are not —
off the air they peak around ±57, so the cast was handing the decoder ~6 bits of
a 16-bit format. That much was real. The *conclusion* was not: I assumed it was
costing decodes, and a controlled test says otherwise. The reference WAV scaled
down to a peak of **13** still decodes all five stations through the raw cast,
identical to full scale — because each symbol is correlated over 8192 samples
and the decision is a ratio of tone powers, so quantisation noise averages out.
The normalisation is kept as insurance for a genuinely quiet capture, and is
labelled as insurance rather than as a fix.

**What actually explained 1-of-8** was the per-candidate logging, added for
exactly this reason: candidate 0 scored 2.16e6 and decoded; candidates 1–6 sat
in a tight cluster at 2.15–3.28e5, i.e. the noise floor. One real signal was on
the air and the loop found it. A bare "0 decodes" line could never have
distinguished that from a broken receiver.

## Update — the decoder invented a station, and two guards now measure against it

Simulation mode, first hardware run. The window is entirely synthetic (the
radio was wedged, so there is no real audio at all) and holds six phantom
stations whose callsigns all end in `SIM` by construction. It produced a
seventh:

    DECODED 'LG9TPW' 'FQ54' 17 dBm  f=1442.23 Hz dt=4.76s cycles=1534

That is a **false decode**, and it passed every existing plausibility check:
17 dBm is a legal WSPR power, the callsign and grid are well formed, the
message repacks, and 1534 is inside `WSPR_CYCLES_SUSPECT` (2000). It sat
6.6 Hz from a genuine decode at 1448.82 Hz — about one WSPR signal bandwidth,
i.e. a candidate on a strong signal's skirt.

⚠ **It falsifies the constant's own rationale.** `WSPR_CYCLES_SUSPECT`'s
comment says 2000 sits *"far below any observed false-decode cycle count"*.
Here is one at 1534. The other half of that rationale is *corroborated*
though, from independent audio: all six genuine phantoms converged at **81**
cycles, inside the reference WAV's own 82–102 band.

This matters more than a display artefact. A WSPR spot is a **reception
report**. Publishing a station that was never on the air is a fabricated
measurement — the thing refused everywhere else in this project (the RST
placeholder rule, the PSK Reporter callsign guard).

### Two guards, and why both are kept

- **NEAR** — reject a decode within 10 Hz of one already accepted this cycle.
  Surgical; two WSPR signals closer than ~6 Hz overlap anyway.
- **SLOW** — reject a decode needing more than 250 Fano cycles. Blunt, and it
  could cost sensitivity.

⭐ **Both are MEASURED on every decode, whichever is enforced**, and each
decode logs `would[near=..,slow=..]`. A guard computed only when enabled can
never be compared against the alternative on the SAME signals — that needs two
flashes and two different band conditions. This way one ordinary receiving
session accumulates the evidence to choose. Enforcement flips at runtime with
`{"action":"wspr_guards","near":1,"slow":0}`, deliberately NOT an NVS setting:
it is an experiment knob, not a user preference.

Default: NEAR enforced, SLOW measured only. The risk is asymmetric — a missed
spot is invisible, a false spot is published — so an untested sensitivity trade
is not enforced by default.

### Bench (host harness, the real WSJT reference WAV)

All five known-good decodes still pass and **neither guard would reject any of
them**. Genuine cycles run 81–118 against the 250 threshold (2.1x margin), and
the closest genuine pair is **14.28 Hz** against the 10 Hz threshold.

⚠ **That NEAR margin is only 1.43x**, thinner than the "6 Hz signals cannot
overlap" reasoning assumed — real WSPR packs closer than that. If field data
ever shows NEAR rejecting a genuine decode, **drop the threshold before
dropping the guard.**

Mutation-tested: widening NEAR to 100 Hz, tightening SLOW to 50, and removing
the `d >= 0.0` sentinel are all caught. The last matters most — without it the
guard rejects the FIRST decode of every cycle, because "nothing accepted yet"
is a negative sentinel.

### Hardware

Four phantoms transmitted, four decoded, `0 guarded`, every `dnear` logged and
the first decode of each cycle correctly showing `dnear=-1.00` and passing.

⭐ **The rejection path was proven, not assumed.** A guard that never fires
looks exactly like a guard that does not work (the #189 trap). Rather than wait
for a stochastic false decode, the threshold was widened at runtime to force
it:

    guards now: near=ENFORCED (200.0 Hz)  slow=measured (250 cycles)
    GUARDED 'W1SIM' 'FN42' f=1445.43 Hz cycles=81 dnear=30.12 Hz
            - rejected by NEAR (near=1 slow=0)

Measured distance, correct verdict, correct log, `would[]` still reporting both
guards. Restored to 10 Hz afterwards; the experiment needed no reflash, which
is what the dev action is for.

⚠ **Demonstrated by construction, not observed:** that LG9TPW *specifically*
would be caught. It sat 6.6 Hz from a genuine decode and the mechanism provably
rejects anything inside `near_hz`, so it follows — but that exact false decode
has not recurred to watch it happen.
