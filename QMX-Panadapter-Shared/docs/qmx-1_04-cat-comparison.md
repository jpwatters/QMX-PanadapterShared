# QMX firmware 1_03_002 vs 1_04_002 — 1:1 CAT + feature comparison

**Purpose:** prepare the panadapter for QMX `1_04` compatibility and identify the new
capabilities worth utilising. This is TODO item **#22** (and unblocks **#3**, one-button TUNE).

**Sources** (pulled 2026-07-03):

**⚠ Betas kept coming — checked again 2026-08-12.** This document was written against
`1_04_002`; the bench radio has been on **`1_04_004`** for a while and **`1_04_005`** and
**`1_04_006`** have since appeared. I only noticed because the operator saw the release
post, having assumed 004 was current — so check the changelog before concluding anything
is unfixed. Entries since 1_04_002 that touch us:

| Version | Entry | Why it matters here |
|---|---|---|
| **1_04_006** (12-Aug-2026) | "Bug fix: TX underlines the correct VFO indicator character now in B and Split mode" | Same area as the dual-VFO display that survives our split stand-down (see the report drafted for Stan KC7XE). **Our finding was measured on 1_04_004** — re-test on 006 before pursuing it. Not the same bug on its face: ours is the second frequency remaining on screen after split is cleared, not the underline |
| **1_04_006** | "Show S-meter in Digi mode" | Radio-side display only. Nothing for us |
| **1_04_006** | "Protection disabled when not in CW mode or when internal GPS (QLG3 in QMX+) selected" | The GPS/paddle-port protection that drops the radio into practice mode with a `G`. From 006 it applies only in CW **and** with the external GPS selected, so a QMX+ using its internal QLG3 is unaffected. Any user-facing note about practice mode while a GPS is connected is now version-dependent |
| **1_04_005** (06-Aug-2026) | "Bug fix: CAT `GP` command had reversed longitude sign" | We do not use `GP`. Noted so nobody re-derives it |
| **1_04_005** | first-dit spike, PA mod test, key-down current spike | Radio-side. Nothing for us |
| **1_04_001** | "Bug fix: CAT MU command and MM (when auto update enabled) loaded previously saved state (VFO etc)" | Directly relevant, and found late. "MM when auto update enabled" is **MM Effect = Immediate**. So `MU;` and MM-with-auto-reload mishandling saved VFO state is a KNOWN, already-fixed bug class. It also fits what we measured on 1_04_004: `MU;` discards session state (IQ mode `Q9` — the spectrum goes flat while USB audio keeps flowing at full rate) while an `MM` Set with MM Effect = Immediate does **not**. The two reload paths behave differently on purpose |

### ⭐ 2026-08-29: the CAT surface DID change — six new commands, and we had the wrong manual

This document was written against the **1_04_001** CAT manual, and §1's command diff is
therefore two revisions stale. QRP Labs has published a **CAT programming manual for
firmware 1_04_004 and above** (`cat_1_04_004.pdf`, 23-Jul-2026), now cached as
`docs/qmx-reference/QMX_CAT_manual_1.04.004.pdf` with a `pdftotext -layout` extract at
`cat_104_004.txt`. It covers 004 **through 008**, so it is authoritative for everything
current.

⚠ **Its page footers still read "firmware 1_04_003"** — Hans did not update them. The
document revision history is the authority; you have the right file.

Its own revision history is unambiguous:

| Manual revision | Date | Added |
|---|---|---|
| **1_04_003** | 18-Jul-2026 | commands **BD, BN, BU, UI** |
| **1_04_004** | 23-Jul-2026 | commands **GP** and **SR** |

Diffed mechanically (command headings from both extracts): **6 added, 0 removed, 53 → 58
documented commands.**

⚠ **A first pass reported `IF` as REMOVED. It is not** — the line is preceded by a
form-feed page break in the extract, so a `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]:` anchor skipped it. `IF` is
present in both (1_04_001 line 110, 1_04_004 line 163). Standing lesson, already in
CLAUDE.md's serial-capture rules and equally true here: **a regex over extracted text
invents changes.** Confirm any apparent removal by grepping for the command itself.

#### What each one means for us

| Cmd | From | What it does | Impact here |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SR** | 1_04_004 | Get/Set SWR-protection lock. `SR;` returns 0/1; `SR<any digit>;` resets the latch | ⭐ **HIGH — replaces a workaround we still ship.** We clear the SWR latch with a `TX;`/`RX;` dance (v0.15.17) and *infer* the state; v1.9.2 put that inferred state on the web page for Randy N4OPI. `SR;` reads the truth and `SR0;` is the documented reset |
| **GP** | 1_04_004 | `GP;` → `GP+DD.DDDDDD+DDD.DDDDDD+YYYYMMDDHHMMSS;` — GPS position **and** date/time. Used by DL2MAN's Winlink app | ⭐ **HIGH — this is the clean answer to #173/#174.** Those are stuck because a clock we pushed is indistinguishable from a GPS-disciplined clock. **A POSITION is not**: we never push one, so a valid fix is positive proof of GPS in a way no timestamp can be. It would also let a GPS-equipped QMX+ fill in the operator's Maidenhead grid. ⚠ **Gate at ≥1_04_005, not 004** — the changelog records the longitude sign as reversed until 005. An earlier row in this document says "we do not use `GP`"; that stands as a statement of today's code and is **no longer the recommendation** |
| **BN** | 1_04_003 | Get/Set band by **index** into the Band Configuration table (`BN2;` = 40 m on an 80–20 QMX; Get returns the current index) | **MEDIUM.** We tune by frequency and let the radio pick the band, so we do not need the Set. The **Get** is the interesting half: `RG` (RF gain) is **per band**, which is exactly why we refuse to store it — `BN;` names the slot the radio is actually on |
| **BU / BD** | 1_04_003 | Band up / band down, equivalent to double-clicking the Volume knob and rotating one click | **LOW.** We set frequency directly, which is strictly more precise |
| **UI** | 1_04_003 | 96-bit STM32 unique ID as 24 hex chars | **LOW.** A stable per-radio identity. Nothing needs it today |

All six need a version gate. `cat_qmx_fw_at_least()` already exists (it parses the cached
`VN;` string) and is the mechanism used for AM and SWR Tune: **1,4,3** for BD/BN/BU/UI,
**1,4,5** for GP (not 4 — see the sign bug), **1,4,4** for SR.

**The dev bench is already on `1_04_004`**, so BD/BN/BU/UI/SR can be exercised today; GP
wants 005 or later.

### ⛔ 2026-09-20: WE SUPPORT UP TO 1_04_010. 1_04_011 IS NOT APPROVED.

Operator's call, on the strength of the QRP Labs group thread the morning after
1_04_011 (19-Sep-2026) went out. The one report that is OURS:

> **Gyula HA3HZ:** *"I'm having a transmission issue with the Tab5 using CAT control - there is no output power. I reverted to version 1.4.10, and it works fine there."*

That is our `TX;` / `TA<freq>;` / `RX;` burst path, i.e. every FT8, FT4 and WSPR
transmission the panadapter makes.

### ⭐ REPRODUCED AND NARROWED ON THE BENCH, same morning

Dev QMX, 20 m, dummy load, `Max. PA voltage` 11.8 V, **both sweeps in the same
Tab5 boot six minutes apart** with nothing but the radio firmware changed.
Instrument: Calibrate Power, which keys with exactly those primitives at 44 PA
voltages and reads `PC;` back at each.

| | 1_04_010 | 1_04_011 |
|---|---|---|
| 1.3 V | 0.10 W | 0.00 W |
| 5.8 V | 1.00 W | 0.00 W |
| 11.8 V | **3.50 W** | **0.00 W** |
| SWR into the dummy load | steady **1.06-1.08** | wandering **1.32-2.24** |

⭐ **The SWR figure is what makes this "no RF" rather than "a mis-reported
`PC;`"**: a bridge with real forward power reads a steady 1.06 into a dummy
load, and noise without it. Reading `PC00;` alone could not have told the two
apart.

⭐ **And the radio still transmits on 011 - it is the DiGi CAT path only.**
`MD3;` then `KD1;` answers `PC35;` at `SW105;`, the same 3.5 W the sweep could
not produce one minute earlier. So the PA, the LPF, the load and the PA voltage
are all fine.

**Ruled out by measuring, each one:**

| Candidate | Test | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| SWR protection latched | `SR;` | `SR0;` |
| CW Practice mode (011 changed it - "no RF emitted" is exactly this symptom) | `LC;` | no `P`, no `G` |
| PA voltage left low | `MMProtection\|Max. PA voltage;` | `MM11.8;` |
| `TA` argument form | `TA1500.0;` vs `TA1500;` | `PC00;` either way |
| Commands refused | every `TX;` / `TA...;` | no `?;` |
| Config reset by the update | band table at both CAT link-ups | **identical**, Band[0..8] |

That last row is what makes the A/B one variable, and it was checked rather
than assumed. ⚠ `KD1;` in DiGi answers `?;` - key state is CW-only - so the
"is it the keying or the tone" half cannot be tested directly from CAT.

⭐ **Ralph DL1HR's retraction does not contradict Gyula.** He was checking
FREQUENCY CONTROL through flrig, which never sends a Digi tone burst. Two
different paths; both reports can be true. Worth remembering before letting a
withdrawal talk you out of a measurement.

Reported to the QRP Labs group with the numbers on 2026-09-20. Evidence in
`scratchpad/qmx-011-test.md` (gitignored - the numbers that matter are above).

### Separate, NOT part of this fault

`MMSystem config|GPS & Ser. ports|USB serial ports;` reads **`MM1;`** on the dev
radio, so interface 5 does not exist and **Radio Menus cannot open**
(`qmx_term: port 2 (interface 5) would not open (0x105)`). It wants 2. Untested
on 010, so it is NOT filed against 011 - but it means **1_04_011's
multi-terminal locking clean-up is still untested**, which was the other reason
for loading 011 at all.

Docs changed the same day: quick-start, troubleshooting and README now say
1.03.002 **up to 1.04.010**, with a warning naming the symptom. ⛔ **No firmware
gate was added**, deliberately - a hardcoded "011 is bad" ships into a binary
that lives for months, and Hans will very likely fix this in 012 within days.
The claim belongs in documents that can be corrected in an hour, not in a
`cat_qmx_fw_at_least()` test.

### Changelog since 1_04_006

| Version | Entry | Why it matters here |
|---|---|---|
| **1_04_011** (19-Sep-2026) | **#4 "Major clean-up of multi-terminal functionality (locking etc)"** | ⚠ **The highest-risk entry for us in this whole line.** Radio Menus (#147, `qmx_term.c`) holds a terminal session on the radio's SECOND serial port (interface 5) while CAT keeps polling interface 0, and closing it walks the radio's own "Exit terminal" by reading the screen. Locking between concurrent terminal users is exactly what that leans on. **Untested against 011**, and 011 is not approved, so this is a thing to check when the next release is |
| **1_04_011** | **#8 "Bug fix: Don't stop SWR Tune display when a CAT character is received"** | ✅ Radio-side fix for the hazard Stan KC7XE described in thread #176111 - *"in that menu ANY character sent over the CAT interface will lock up the radio controls"*. Our own Antenna Tune was never affected (Stan re-tested it: CAT-entered `MD8;` Tune is fine), but a user entering Tune from the FRONT PANEL with the Tab5 polling was. Fixed for 011 and later - which the two freeze reports above unfortunately make academic for now |
| **1_04_010** (14-Sep-2026) | **#6 "CAT not reporting correct frequency during Virtual U3S operations"**, #7 radio not returned to the normal frequency between vU3S TX slots, #8 vU3S RX not on the stated frequency | ✅ Anyone running the radio's OWN beacon with the Tab5 attached had `FA;` lying to us, so the dial readout, the band-plan strip and every frequency-derived overlay were wrong. Nothing to do on our side; fixed ≥010 |
| **1_04_009** (30-Aug-2026) | "Bug fix: Accidentally WSPR was transmitted 250 Hz too low - now it's correct" | **Not us, and have the answer ready** - this is the radio's own Virtual U3S encoder. Our WSPR TX synthesises the 162 symbols itself and keys them with `TA<freq>;`, so the transmitted frequency was never the radio's to get wrong |
| **1_04_008** (27-Aug-2026) | "Added all remaining U3S modes to Virtual U3S" and **"Added RTTY to Virtual U3S (not available in real U3S)"** | The radio can now beacon RTTY itself. `JS8 / RTTY` sits in our roadmap behind `docs/rtty-feasibility.md`, where the cost was always the **transmit** side. If the QMX will key RTTY natively, the Tab5's part shrinks to choosing the frequency, showing the waterfall and driving it over CAT. Also worth thinking about against the WSPR page we shipped in v1.10.0: the radio's Virtual U3S is a standalone beacon, ours is receive + spots + reporting + transmit. Not a conflict; a question about what each is for. **No CAT change** — Virtual U3S is configured from the radio's own menus |
| **1_04_007** (14-Aug-2026) | **"Bug fix: Fixed the 160m image rejection (90-degree quad LO phase relationship on 160m)"** | ⚠ **Do NOT file this as the cause of #118.** #118's phantom CW is reproducible on demand by a front-panel menu visit and cured by re-asserting IQ mode, which points at `Q9` session state, not LO phase — and it is not 160m-specific. What it *does* do is **weaken one piece of our own supporting evidence**: CLAUDE.md's spur section says the phantom-CW reports on low bands "stand on their own as evidence that image rejection is poor". On 160 m that was a known radio-side defect, fixed in 007, so it is no longer independent evidence |
| **1_04_007** | Stored-CW-message fixes (frequency written as 00,000,000; continuous key-down between repeats), leading-edge CW RF spikes reintroduced in 006 | Radio-side. Relevant only to the CW page work on `feat/cw-page` |
| **1_04_007** | "Image Sweep screen had incorrect result first time it ran" | Radio-side display |

**Is 1_04 GA yet? Still not ANNOUNCED - but the evidence moved, and the docs did.**
The changelog labels **1_04_000, 001 and 002** "Beta firmware version"; **003 through
011 carry no such label**. That on its own is the *absence* of a marker, and a
summarising fetch reading it as "general release" is how that becomes a false claim -
it happened again on 2026-09-20 and was caught by re-reading the raw page. What HAS
changed since this paragraph was written is positive rather than absent: QRP Labs has
published a full **operating manual** and a full **CAT programming manual** "for
firmware 1_04_004 and above", which is an act, not a missing word.

So our documents no longer call them betas - they say **1.03.002 up to 1.04.010** -
while still not claiming a GA nobody announced.

**Also newer than our cache:** an **operating manual for 1_04_004 and above** (23-Jul-2026)
and a **Virtual U3S manual for 1_04_008a and above** (28-Aug-2026). Note "**008a**" — a
revision beyond 008 exists or is imminent. Neither is downloaded yet.

---

**Status of 1_04 (as of 2026-07-03, superseded above):** still **BETA**, no GA. Three betas so far.
`1_04_000` was QMX+-only (hung on QMX — fixed in `1_04_001`). `1_04_002` is one unified
image for QMX and QMX+, and **installing it executes a Factory Reset** (all radio settings
wiped; the user must re-select their firmware variant at the post-reset prompt).
`1_04_002` itself is only fixes on top of `1_04_001` (SWR-style EEPROM init, Virtual U3S
fixes, grid-locator display, repeated-CW-message truncation) — **no CAT changes between
1_04_001 and 1_04_002**, so the 1_04_001 CAT manual is authoritative for 1_04_002.

**Recommendation (superseded 2026-09-20):** this used to read *"`1_03_002` remains the
known-good firmware in our quick-start"*. It is now **1.03.002 up to 1.04.010**, with
1_04_011 explicitly not approved - see the section at the top.

---

## 1. Command-by-command CAT diff (manual 1_03_000 → 1_04_001)

### 1.1 New commands in 1_04

| Cmd | What it does | Relevance to us |
|---|---|---|
| **AI** | Auto-Info mode, now properly implemented: `AI0` off, `AI1` old format (auto `IF;` on any change **+ every 1.5 s**), `AI2` extended format (auto `IF;` on change only), `AI3` both | ⚠️ Biggest risk AND biggest opportunity. Risk: anything that enables AI makes the QMX emit **unsolicited `IF;` frames** that would interleave with our FA/MD/FW poll parsing — `process_cat_message()` has no `IF` handler today. Opportunity: `AI2` is an event-driven push of freq/mode/TX-state that could replace much of our 50 ms poll loop (§4.2). The 1_03 landmine ("never send `AI1;` — corrupts FA polling for the session") may or may not be fixed; **verify on hardware only** |
| **KD** | Get/Set key state: `KD1;` key-down, `KD0;` key-up, `KD;` reads | Optional: positive TX-keyed confirmation during FT8 bursts; remote CW keying. No current need — `TX;`/`RX;` + `TA` cover us |
| **MU** | Force reload of configuration parameters (activate pending `MM` Set writes) | Key to possibly simplifying the 3-write SSB-filter dance (§4.3) |
| **PS** | `PS0;` = complete power-off (clean shutdown); `PS;` always returns `PS1;` | Easy new feature: "Power off QMX" button in web UI / drawer (§4.4) |
| **TR** | Get/Set Tune Rate (knob step, `0`=10 MHz … `7`=10 Hz) | No current use; noted for completeness |
| **RR** | Get/Set RIT Rate (`4`=1 kHz … `8`=1 Hz) | No current use (we don't touch RIT) |

### 1.2 Changed commands

| Cmd | 1_03_000 manual | 1_04_001 manual | Impact on our code |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MD** | Set/Get: `3` (CW), `6` (FSK), `7` (CWR), `9` (FSR) *(manual predates SSB; real 1_03_002 also does 1/2 LSB/USB)* | Set/Get: `1` LSB, `2` USB, `3` CW, **`5` AM (new, 1_04_001)**, `6` FSK, `7` CWR, **`8` SWR Tune (new)**, `9` FSR. Note: **no `4` (FM)** — QMX has no FM | Our `kw_modes[]` table in `cat.c` already labels `5`→"AM" ✓. Digit `8` currently displays `"?"` — now shows `"TUNE"` (shipped). ⚠️ **How to *exit* Tune via CAT is NOT documented**: the manual's own Set list for `MD` is `1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9` — `0` never appears in it. The "`MD0;` exits" claim in earlier project notes traces to the original changelog summary, not the manual body — treat it as unverified until tested on hardware. The safe fallback is setting `MD` back to whatever digit was active before Tune was entered. ⚠️ **`MD;` Get lies while tuning**: after `MD8;` a Get returns the **prior** mode, not `8` (found on hardware 2026-07-03, confirmed by Stan KC7XE 2026-08-09 — "either a feature or a bug", the radio remembering where to return to). Digit `8` is therefore unreachable via the poll, and there is **no CAT signal for "the radio left Tune"** — `tune_modal.c` owns the session state itself |
| **PC** | "power output in tenths of a watt", e.g. `PC45;` = 4.5 W | Same manual text, but the changelog adds: **returns 3 digits when power ≥ 10 W** | Already handled — `cat_query_power_swr()`/`cat_pwr_swr_async_read()` were re-calibrated for the 3-digit case (see CLAUDE.md) ✓ |
| **MM** (semantics) | MM Set stores to EEPROM; when the new value takes effect is undocumented | New **"MM Effect"** config parameter (System config → CAT config): **"Immediate"** = every MM Set auto-reloads config and takes effect at once; **"On demand"** = takes effect only on menu enter/exit or on `MU;` | Directly relevant to the hard-won SSB-filter recipe (§4.3). Also `1_04_001` changelog: "CAT MU command and MM loaded previously saved state" bug was fixed |

### 1.3 Unchanged commands (manual text byte-identical apart from pagination)

`AG` `C2` `FA` `FB` `FR` `FT` `FW` `ID` `IF` `KS` `KY`(both variants) `LC` `ML` `OM` `PL`
`Q0`–`Q9` `QA` `QB` `QC` `QJ` `RC` `RD` `RG` `RT` `RU` `RX` `SA` `SM` `SP` `SS` `SW` `TA`
`TB` `TM` `TQ` `TX` `VN`

Notably for us: **`FA`, `FW`, `TM`, `TA`, `TX`, `RX`, `PC`-format, `SW`, `VN`, `ID` and `Q9`
are all textually unchanged** — the entire FT8 TX burst sequence and the poll loop are
spec-stable across the upgrade.

> ⚠️ `Q9` being "unchanged" in the manual does **not** match field evidence: Dirk DK7CVD's
> `1_04` unit silently failed to apply `Q9 1;` (IQ mode stayed off; radio's own System
> Config showed it disabled). Our v0.19.3/v0.19.4 mitigations (4× handshake retry,
> echo-aware readback, red on-screen banner) exist precisely for this. Root cause on the
> QMX side is unverified — top item for hardware testing (§5).

## 2. Our CAT surface, mapped against 1_04

Everything the panadapter sends/parses today, and whether 1_04 changes it:

| We use | Where | 1_04 status |
|---|---|---|
| `FA;` / `FA<11d>;` | poll + touch-to-tune (`cat.c`) | unchanged ✓ |
| `MD;` / `MD<d>;` | poll + mode set (`cat.c`) | range widened (5, 8 can now appear in responses; 4 never will) — table tolerant, `8` label cosmetic |
| `FW;` | poll (suppressed while SSB BW pinned) | unchanged; the *read-reasserts-stale-width* behaviour is undocumented in both manuals → re-verify on 1_04 (§5) |
| `VN;` | once at link-up | unchanged ✓ (will report `1_04_002`) |
| `ID;` | link-up | unchanged ✓ (`ID020;`) |
| `Q9 1;` / `Q9;` | IQ-mode enable + confirm (`link_task`) | manual unchanged; **field-broken on 1_04** — see §1.3 warning |
| `TM;` / `TM<hhmmss>;` | time sync (`time_sync.c`) | unchanged ✓ |
| `TX;` `TA<f>;` `TA0;` `RX;` | FT8/FT4 burst (`ft8_tx.c`) | unchanged ✓ |
| `PC;SW;` | post-burst power/SWR | PC 3-digit already handled ✓ |
| `MMSSB\|Filter RX=` / `MMSSB\|Bandwidth=` | SSB BW recipe (`cat.c`) | menu **paths** must be re-verified — 1_04 reorganised the CAT config submenu and added menu items; our paths are name-based (robust by design) but unproven on 1_04 (§5) |
| `MMCW\|CW passband=` / `MMCW\|CW offset;` | CW BW + pitch | same as above |
| `MMBand config.\|Band name (m)[i];` / `\|Frequency center[i];` | band table read | same as above |

**Never sent, still forbidden:** `AI1;` (1_03 landmine). On 1_04 this becomes a documented
feature but stays untouchable until hardware-verified.

---

## 3. Non-CAT 1_04 features (operating-manual level)

| Feature | What | Panadapter angle |
|---|---|---|
| **AM receive mode** (experimental, 150–3200 Hz filter) | new RX mode, MD digit 5 | UI already labels AM; snap grid already has an AM step. What `FW;` returns in AM is undocumented — check on hardware. Could add AM to our mode selector once verified |
| **SWR Tune mode** ("hold TX = TUNE", or `MD8;`) | radio transmits carrier, shows SWR | the enabler for TODO **#3** one-button TUNE (§4.1) |
| **Virtual U3S** (complete Ultimate3S QRSS/WSPR beacon inside the QMX) | standalone beacon mode | nothing to do — radio-native; panadapter would just be disconnected/idle. Don't try to CAT-poll while it beacons until tested |
| **Symmetric phase** SSB setting (recommend YES) + LSB TX distortion fix | TX audio quality | TX-side; worth an I/Q-image A/B on RX out of curiosity, nothing to code |
| **Supply protection** (SMPS safeguard), **SWR warn style**, **Modes enabled** config, fullscreen CW practice decode, LCD grid-edit UI, **PTT from DTR** | radio-native niceties | no panadapter surface. "Modes enabled" *could* hide modes from the radio's own menu — should not affect CAT `MD` set, but note it as a support-question source |

---

## 4. Opportunities — the "nice new features" ranked

### 4.1 One-button TUNE (TODO #3) — IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-03, pending hardware verification
Shipped as a dedicated drawer button (`DRAWER_SEC_TUNE` in `ui.c`), gated on
`cat_qmx_fw_at_least(1, 4, 0)` — invisible on `1_03_002`. Deliberately NOT folded into the
USB/LSB/CW/DiGi mode popup: Tune keys the radio continuously, so it gets the same
confirm-and-visible-ACTIVE-state treatment as FT8 TX/robot mode. Entering sends
`cat_request_mode("TUNE")` (→ `MD8;`) through the existing poll-task deferral; a live
SWR/power label polls `PC;SW;` via a new 4th poll-task phase
(`cat_tune_poll_set_active()`), active only during Tune. Exit restores the mode that was
active before Tune was entered (see §1.2 — NOT a bare `MD0;`, which the manual never
documents as valid), backed by a 60 s auto-timeout and continued `MD;` polling so an exit
via the radio's own front panel is also picked up. **Still needs real hardware to confirm:
does restoring the prior mode digit actually exit the radio's own Tune UI cleanly, and
what do `FW;`/other polls return while Tune is active?** — see the checklist in §5.

### 4.2 `AI2` event-driven state push — biggest architectural win, highest risk
`AI2` makes the QMX push an `IF;` frame on every freq/mode/TX-state change. That could
replace most of the 50 ms FA/MD round-robin: lower CDC traffic, faster UI response to
knob turns, and it shrinks the cross-thread-write race window that has cost us several
bugs. Needs: an `IF` response parser (fixed-format, documented §1.1), fallback to polling
if AI stops flowing, and proof that AI no longer corrupts the session like 1_03's `AI1;`
did. **Do not attempt any AI experiment on 1_03_002.**

### 4.3 Simplify the SSB-filter 3-write dance — deferred until proven
Hypothesis to test on 1_04: with "MM Effect = Immediate" (or an explicit `MU;` after the
MM Set), writing `MMSSB|Filter RX=` alone may now both persist *and* apply, and the
`FW;`-read-reverts-the-width bug may be gone (the `1_04_001` "MM loaded previously saved
state" fix smells related). If so, we can drop `s_ssb_bw_pinned` and the FW-poll
suppression — restoring live BW display while pinned. **Keep the current recipe until a
1_04 unit proves each step**; it must also keep working on 1_03_002 (runtime-gate any
simplification on `VN;`).

### 4.4 "Power off QMX" button — trivial once verified
`PS0;` is a clean remote shutdown. Nice for POTA (shut the radio down from the Tab5/web
UI before packing up). One deferred write via the poll task + a confirm dialog.

### 4.5 AM mode surfacing — IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-03, pending hardware verification
Added to both mode selectors (touch popup in `ui.c`, web dropdown in `index.html`), gated
the same way as Tune. The CAT-layer mapping already existed (`hamlib_mode_to_digit`,
digit 5) — the only real gap was that neither selector offered it. **Still unverified:
what `FW;` returns in AM** — if it's something unexpected, the passband-width label/overlay
could show garbage; no fixed passband overlay was added since the correct value isn't
known yet. Check on first real 1_04 contact.

**AM bandwidth is NOT selectable — do not add an AM BW menu (settled 2026-07-04, from the
manuals).** Field question: "why is AM fixed at 3.2 kHz, should there be other BWs?" Answer,
straight from the 1_04_001 manuals:
- `FW:` (CAT manual) is **get-only** — *"Returns 3200 in Digi mode, and 0300 for CW mode."*
  There is no `FW` Set. So the 3.2k the UI shows in AM is just the radio reporting the upper
  edge of its filter; it is not a value we (or the user) can change via `FW`.
- The "150–3200 Hz" figure is **one fixed filter, not a range**: the operation manual calls it
  the *"default 150-3200 Hz wide filter used for Digital modes"* (§CW Filters, the `None`
  option description). AM uses that same single wide audio filter.
- The QMX exposes selectable RX bandwidths **only** for SSB (2500/2700/2900/3200 via
  `MMSSB|Bandwidth`) and CW (the 54-filter set via `MMCW`). **Digi and AM have no filter
  selection at all** — no `MMAM|…` filter item exists, and the SSB filter menu is SSB-only.

Therefore `bw_popup_open()` in `ui.c` correctly returns without a menu for AM (and Digi) —
there is nothing to pick. The only *unverified* angle is whether writing `MMSSB|Bandwidth=`
while in AM would narrow the AM audio anyway; the manual gives no indication it does, so
don't add it speculatively — it'd need a bench test and might just return `?;`. The AM
passband *overlay* is drawn symmetric (±1600 Hz from FW=3200), which is cosmetically not
ideal for AM (really ±audio-BW around the carrier) — a display-only tweak if ever wanted,
unrelated to the (non-existent) BW selection.

Not worth pursuing now: `KD` (nothing our TX path lacks), `TR`/`RR` (knob ergonomics,
radio-side), `LC`/`TB` (LCD mirror / CW-decode text — cute, no demand).

## 5. Hardware verification checklist (blocks everything above)

Run against a real `1_04_002` unit, in this order — each item independent:

1. **Regression pass on the unchanged surface:** connect, IQ handshake, FA/MD/FW poll,
   touch-to-tune, FT8 RX decode, one FT8 TX burst into dummy load, `TM;` time sync,
   `PC;SW;` readout (at both <10 W and ≥10 W if the unit allows).
2. **`Q9 1;` IQ mode** — does Dirk's silent-failure reproduce? Does our 4× retry recover
   it, or does the red banner fire? Check the radio's own System Config → IQ Mode after.
3. **MM paths** — `MMSSB|Filter RX;`, `MMSSB|Bandwidth;`, `MMCW|CW passband;`,
   `MMCW|CW offset;`, `MMBand config.|Band name (m)[0];` all still resolve (no `?;`).
4. **`FW;` revert behaviour** — set a width, resume FW polling, see if it still snaps back.
   Then test "MM Effect = Immediate" + single `Filter RX` write (§4.3 hypothesis).
5. **`MD8;` Tune** — the "Antenna Tune" drawer button (implemented 2026-07-03) should
   appear automatically once `VN;` confirms `1_04`+. Tap it, confirm the radio actually
   enters Tune and transmits, confirm the live SWR/power label updates, then tap "Stop
   Tune" and confirm the radio returns cleanly to the mode it was in before (this is the
   real unknown — our code restores the prior mode digit rather than sending a bare
   `MD0;`, since the manual's Set list never lists 0; if that DOESN'T cleanly exit Tune on
   real hardware, this needs a different exit mechanism entirely). Also let the 60 s
   auto-timeout fire once on purpose to confirm it recovers cleanly. Separately confirm AM
   in the mode selector — Set works, and check what `FW;` reports once in AM.
   **Do this on a dummy load**, and note two things already settled by Stan KC7XE
   (2026-08-09) so they don't get re-tested here: CAT commands are safe while Tune is
   entered via `MD8;` (the lock-up is front-panel-menu only), and `MD;` will report the
   pre-Tune mode throughout — that is expected, not a failed entry. Judge "did it enter
   Tune" from the radio transmitting and the SWR/power readout, never from `MD;`.
6. **`AI` modes** — last, on an expendable session: `AI2;`, watch for unsolicited `IF;`
   frames, then `AI0;` and confirm normal polling still works. If anything corrupts,
   power-cycle and record it — that alone decides whether §4.2 is viable.
7. **`PS0;`** — clean shutdown works, radio comes back on a power cycle.

## 6. Safe-now code changes (harmless on 1_03_002)

- [x] `cat.c` `kw_modes[]`: digit `8` → `"TUNE"` (was `"?"`) — done 2026-07-03; keeps the
      top bar honest if a 1_04 user enters SWR Tune from the radio menu while connected.
- [x] Unsolicited `IF...;` frames: already handled — unmatched responses fall through
      `process_cat_message()` silently (no per-line warning), so an AI-enabled session
      wouldn't spam the diag log. Nothing to change.
- Everything else waits for hardware.
