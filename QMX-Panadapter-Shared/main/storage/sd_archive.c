/* ⛔ HOW LONG A BROWSER MAY HOLD OFF THE CARD WRITES (Gyula HA3HZ, 2026-09-10:
 * the web page "freezing" in CW mode).
 *
 * A background card write takes SECONDS on this board and the spectrum stream
 * is down for all of it - measured the same evening, with the radio on CW and
 * a card mounted:
 *
 *   diag mirror   3107 ms / 9783 ms / 14767 ms   writing 4096 B
 *   cw transcript  286 ms / 10103 ms /  3815 ms  writing 25-60 B
 *
 * That is the SD-vs-WiFi contention this file already documents at length, and
 * SPI mode made it rarer rather than gone. It is not new and it is not the CW
 * transcript's doing: the diag mirror has run every 30 s since #153, and it is
 * the worse of the two.
 *
 * ⛔ THE ANSWER IS NOT TO WRITE LESS OFTEN WHILE SOMEONE WATCHES. v1.12.3 did
 * exactly that and the deferral was REMOVED on 2026-09-12, because a web page
 * is a MONITOR and must not change what the device records. Leaving one open
 * overnight took the mirror from 4 KB/30 s to 4 KB/180 s - 23 B/s - which is
 * below what WSPR alone produces, so the card fell four hours behind and the SD
 * record of a ten-hour soak ended at 6.5 h. A monitor that silently truncates
 * the log is worse than a stuttering spectrum.
 *
 * ⭐ The numbers above are also the way out, and they were in the log all along:
 * 3107 ms for 4096 B, and elsewhere "8,942 ms to write ONE byte". The cost is
 * per WRITE, not per byte - the open, the fsync, the close, the contention. So
 * mirror_diag_slow() drains up to 64 KB inside ONE open at the same 30 s
 * cadence. The stream is interrupted once per 30 s whether or not anybody is
 * looking, which is precisely what makes the browser irrelevant. */

/* ⛔ TEMPORARY EXPERIMENT (#378), DEFAULT 0 - REMOVE WHEN IT HAS ANSWERED.
 *
 * The stream pause exists to protect the SD write by quieting WiFi. But the
 * write takes SECONDS *with the stream already paused* - up to 29,610 ms for
 * 4 KB, measured 2026-09-10 - so the pause may be buying nothing while costing
 * the whole freeze the operator's users report.
 *
 * Set to 1 and the diag mirror ALTERNATES: paused, unpaused, paused... logging
 * which arm each write used. Alternating rather than two flashes on purpose -
 * band conditions and WiFi load drift over minutes, and two builds an hour
 * apart would not be comparing the same thing.
 *
 * It also bypasses the browser deferral, so a sample lands every 30 s instead
 * of every 3 minutes.
 *
 * ⚠ The unpaused arm runs the SD write straight into WiFi contention, which is
 * the hazard the pause was added for. Bounded to a deliberate test session with
 * someone watching; do not ship it enabled. */

 * after a chunk had already been written. Two consequences, and the second is
 * the one that bites:
 *
 *  - mirror_diag() is the CONTINUOUS burst path, and on a WiFi unit it stops

 *    pulled 2026-09-20, is 5,368,581 B - already past SD_LOG_MAX_BYTES.
 *
 *  - ⭐ The rotate is what FREES space (remove() of the previous
 *    qmx-log.1.txt), and it was gated behind a SUCCESSFUL write. On a card with
 *    no room left, the write is exactly the thing that cannot happen, so the
 *    one action that would recover the card was unreachable by construction.
 *
 * Both write paths and the mount now go through this, and the size is checked
 * BEFORE writing as well as after. See sd_archive_task()'s unmount path for

// Parking deliberately is strictly better than being killed: a teardown mid-write

// + directory entry on f_sync/f_close).
// Append whatever the diag ring has produced since the last call, opening and
// closing the file around the write.
//
// ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS (#153). Parking used to stop SD logging entirely once WiFi
// was up, on the reasoning that "the full log is available over the network at
// /api/log". That reasoning fails in exactly the case the log is for: after a
// crash the RAM ring is GONE, and the flash copy is a rolling ~11-minute window.
// Michael KZ4LY sent "the full log from the microSD" to explain a reboot and it
// was 17 boot headers each ending at uptime ~4.8 s - a log that stops before the
// crash every single time, and which LOOKS like evidence.
//
// So the card keeps getting the log, just slowly. Open/append/fsync/close per
// burst is deliberately not the held-open handle the continuous path uses: it
// costs a little more per write and removes the corruption window entirely.
// ⛔ AND WHY IT IS QUIESCED (2026-09-01). #153 restored this write, and THIS
// WRITE IS WHAT TRIPS THE EIO WEDGE - measured on the bench the same morning:
//
//     6.1-8.2s  boot mount attempts 1-4 FAILED err=0x108
//    13.7s      mounted on attempt 5/5                <- the dot comes on
//    42-90s     diag write failed: I/O error (errno 5) x5, mounted=1
//    90.2s      INSTR unmount(write failures)         <- the dot goes out
//
// which is exactly the operator's report: the SD dot appears, then vanishes.
// It is NOT a v1.10.5 regression - no SD code changed in that release - and it
// is not memory: CLAUDE.md records this same EIO with 135 KB of DMA free and a
// 65 KB largest block. It is the documented SPI2-SD vs WiFi-SDIO contention.
//
// Every OTHER place in this firmware that writes the card while WiFi is up
// already knows this and quiets the link first - the QRZ/eQSL/LoTW uploads, the
// log download, the Reader's Save offline, the /files browser. This path, added
// later, did none of it. So it is the one SD write on the device that runs
// straight into the contention with the stream at full rate.
//
// ⚠ SAVE AND RESTORE, never set-then-clear. The pause is a plain boolean shared
// with ~29 other call sites, and upload_task() raises it BEFORE it takes
// sd_archive_lock() - so a 30 s write can land inside an upload's own pause
// window, and clearing it unconditionally would drop that upload's protection
// while it is still running. Which is the very hazard being guarded against.
//
// ⛔ THE WS PAUSE ONLY - NOT dsp_set_transfer_quiet(), which the upload path
// pairs it with. Considered and rejected on 2026-09-01, so it does not get
// "restored" later as an oversight:
//   - It buys nothing here. It exists to stop fft_task (pri 4, core 1)
//     preempting the upload task (pri 3, core 0). THIS task is pri 2 pinned to
//     core 0, so fft_task never preempts it and there is nothing to yield.
//   - And it would cost real decodes. In the quiet branch fft_task DISCARDS
//     audio in 50 ms chunks (dsp.c). An upload is occasional and operator-
//     initiated; this write runs every 30 s forever, so during FT8 it would
//     throw audio away on every cycle - which is #51, the single most expensive
//     bug in this project's history, reintroduced deliberately.
// The contention being avoided is SPI2-SD DMA against WiFi-SDIO DMA, and the
// ~10 fps spectrum stream is the SDIO traffic that matters. Pausing it is the
// whole point; quieting the FFT is not.
//
// ⭐ ONE OPEN, MANY CHUNKS - AND THE COST IS PER WRITE, NOT PER BYTE.
// This used to write exactly DIAG_CHUNK (4 KB) per call, with its own fopen /
// fwrite / fsync / fclose around it. At the #153 cadence of 30 s that is
// 136 B/s, and in WSPR mode the ring produces more than that - so the card's
// copy fell steadily behind the device. Measured overnight 2026-09-11: the
// mirror ended up FOUR HOURS behind, and the SD record of a ten-hour soak
// stopped at 6.5 h.
//
// Writing more per call is very nearly free, and the log said so long before
// anyone asked: "8,942 ms to write ONE byte". A write that takes nine seconds
// for a single byte is not bandwidth-limited, it is paying a fixed cost -
// the open, the fsync, the close, and the SPI2-vs-WiFi contention the pause
// exists to dodge. So drain the backlog inside ONE open instead of taking that
// fixed cost 16 times for 64 KB.
//
// The cap matters in the other direction: the stream is paused for the whole
// burst, so an unbounded drain after a long stall would freeze the browser for
// as long as it took. SLOW_DRAIN_MAX keeps the worst case bounded while still
// being 16x what a single chunk moved.

/* ---- DMA ballast, so a REMOUNT is still possible when the pool is empty ----
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-10-04 on bench dev. Once WiFi, the web server, NimBLE and the
 * QMX are all up, MALLOC_CAP_DMA ends the boot at ~400 B free with a ~176 B
 * largest block (see the per-consumer accounting in commits 34bd189/672fd8a:
 * httpd + ws_push ~21.6 KB, the QMX attach ~7 KB, NimBLE ~5.2 KB). At that
 * point sdmmc_card_init() cannot get its 64-byte buffers:
 *
 *   E heapwatch: ALLOC FAILED: 64 B caps=0x8 in task 'sd_archive'
 *   E heapwatch: ALLOC FAILED: 64 B caps=0x8 in task 'httpd'
 *   W sd_arch: SDFAIL[slowopen] err=0x5 | DMA free=359 lblk=144
 *
 * There are exactly three 64-byte MALLOC_CAP_DMA sites in the card-init path,
 * and sizeof(sdmmc_switch_func_rsp_t) is exactly 64:
 *   sdmmc_check_ssr()              esp_dma_capable_calloc(1, SD_SSR_SIZE)
 *   sdmmc_select_driver_strength() heap_caps_calloc(1, sizeof(rsp), CAP_DMA)
 *   sdmmc_select_current_limit()   heap_caps_calloc(1, sizeof(rsp), CAP_DMA)
 * ⚠ Identified by READING the IDF source, not by catching the failure: the
 * heap_watch callback reports the allocator's name, not the call site, and the
 * failure did not reproduce in the session that instrument was flashed for.
 * The 64-byte match is exact at all three, but it is inference.
 *
 * This is the problem the comments at "can never be remounted" below have
 * described for weeks. The fix is not to free memory - the consumers above are
 * all legitimate - it is to keep a contiguous block in hand from BOOT, when
 * the pool still holds ~138 KB, and lend it back for the duration of a mount.
 *
 * ⛔ The scarce thing is a CONTIGUOUS BLOCK, not free bytes. At the moment of
 * failure there were 359 free bytes but the largest block was 144 B, so even
 * a 64-byte request could fail on fragmentation alone. Releasing one block we
 * allocated early guarantees a contiguous region of this size.
 *
 * ⚠ RISK, stated because it is real: holding this from boot lowers the pool
 * for everyone else by the same amount. The consumers that matter take fixed
 * sizes and take them BEFORE the pool bottoms out (NimBLE at ~19 s with 8-13
 * KB still free), so 1 KB should not displace any of them - but if something
 * starts failing that did not before, this is the first thing to suspect.
 * Keep it small, and keep it one constant. */

     * ensure_dir()'s sibling work and before write_readme() opened and closed
     * another file on the same volume.
     *
     * ⚠ WHAT INSIDE FatFs INVALIDATES IT IS NOT ESTABLISHED. The suspicion is

    // (5.62 s) and attempt 2 (5.97 s). So the probe and the WiFi bring-up now

    // CARD AT ALL the pool went 135 KB -> 4.4 KB across the five attempts,
    // then to 103 B once NimBLE initialised. At that point the device is one
    // allocation away from anything: the same boot recorded sdio_read taking
    // an Instruction access fault with MEPC=0x00000000, and a later probe
    // asserting inside sdmmc_init_host_frequency.
    //
    // Whose bytes those are is NOT yet established - the two overlap, so one

    // the archive is off, and a card init that cannot allocate used to REBOOT
    // the device. Both allocations are brief and early; they were overlapping
    // only because nothing sequenced them. See util/sdio_ready.h for why this
    // is aimed at the card init rather than at "before WiFi", and for the
    // caveat that this is a hypothesis with a clean test.
    //
    // The timeout is generous but bounded, and proceeding on a timeout is
    // deliberate - WiFi may be off, or the sdio_drv.c patch may be missing
