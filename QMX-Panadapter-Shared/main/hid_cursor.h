// Shared pointer state for every mouse the Tab5 can have.
//
// There are two transports and there will likely never be more than two: USB
// (usb_hid_mouse.c - works only when the QMX is unplugged, because a hub puts
// both behind a Transaction Translator that ESP-IDF 5.4.4 does not implement)
// and Bluetooth LE (bt_hid_mouse.c - the only way to have a mouse AND the
// radio at once, since it does not touch the USB host at all).
//
// Both produce the same thing: signed deltas and a button bitmask. Keeping the
// accumulation here means LVGL's pointer indev reads ONE place and does not
// care which mouse is on - and a future third transport is a producer, not a
// change to the UI.
