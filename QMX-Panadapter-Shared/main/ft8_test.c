// ft8_test.c - Continuous FT8 slot loop with pooled, time-budgeted decode.
//
// Two tasks + a decode helper cooperate so every 15-second FT8 slot is decoded
// as fast as possible - aiming to finish the decode BEFORE the slot boundary,
// which a PC running WSJT-X never bothers to do (it idles until t=15 s).
//
//   ft8_task (capture + streaming STFT)
//     Owns the slot-boundary loop and TX logic. For each RX slot it claims a
//     free monitor_t from a small PSRAM pool, then captures audio AND builds
//     that monitor's waterfall block-by-block AS the audio arrives (streaming
//     STFT). An FT8 burst is only 12.64 s of a 15 s slot, so by the time the
//     signal ends the waterfall is already fully built - the STFT cost is
//     overlapped with capture instead of paid afterwards. It posts a
//     decode_job_t (the monitor index) and loops back without waiting.
//
//   ft8_decode_task (decode, core 1) + ft8_decode_worker_task (core 0)
//     The decode task pulls a job, runs candidate-search on the pre-built
//     waterfall, then fans the (independent, reentrant) LDPC candidate loop
//     across BOTH P4 cores: it takes the even-indexed candidates itself while
//     the core-0 helper takes the odd ones, joins on a completion semaphore,
//     merges results, records decodes, advances the QSO state machine, and
//     releases the monitor back to the pool.
//
// Pool + decode budget (carried over from v0.15.13's parity-skew fix): capture
// claims a monitor (s_buf_busy) and the decoder releases it, so capture never
// reuses a waterfall the decoder still owns. FT8_DECODE_BUDGET_MS bounds the
// per-worker candidate loop (strongest-first, so only the weakest tail is
// dropped on the busiest slots) - now a safety net rather than the usual path,
// since streaming STFT + dual-core decode keep a slot's work well under 15 s.
//
// TX slots: ft8_task runs ft8_tx_run() instead of capturing; no job is
// queued for that slot (the radio is transmitting, not receiving).
//
// Every other slot is captured - including the parity opposite an armed TX.
// A capture is exactly one slot long (15 s) and ends on the next boundary, so
// the armed burst still fires on time, and capturing the opposite slot is the
// only way to hear the station we're working (they transmit opposite us).

// slot loop now waits (mid-capture, via the FT8_REPLY_TX_WINDOW_MS machinery

// armed content with the fresh message, then fires it in THIS slot - a burst
// started ~2 s late is well inside every decoder's time-search range (see the
// reply-window comment above; validated on-air at +1032 ms). If the decode
// somehow hasn't landed by this deadline, fire whatever is armed - worst case

// Early-decode (the "reply at dt~=0" path, WSJT-X-style). All the hold/reply
// machinery above ships the fresh reply ~1-2 s late for one reason: the
// partner's decode doesn't even START until the 15 s boundary (capture runs to
// the boundary, decode is then ~1.5-1.9 s). But the FT8 signal itself ends at
// ~12.64 s - the last 2.36 s of every slot is dead air. So mid-QSO, where the
// ONE station whose timing matters is our partner (who is dt~=0 and therefore
// fully inside that 12.64 s), we cut the capture a hair past the signal and
// queue the decode ~2 s early. The decode then finishes BEFORE the next
// boundary, ft8_qso_advance() arms the fresh reply in time, and the normal
// boundary TX path fires it at dt~=0 - no doubles, no cycle lost, and a low dt
// for every receiving station. If a busy-band decode still overruns the
// boundary the hold/reply machinery above catches it exactly as before (small
// positive dt, never a skipped slot). BOTH PROTOCOLS since the guard below was
// derived rather than tabulated - it was FT8-only, for no reason beyond the
// mode the original report came from. The cut lands one RX-latency guard past
// the signal end: 13.2 s of a 15 s FT8 slot, 5.6 s of a 7.5 s FT4 slot.
/* ⭐ DERIVED, NOT TABULATED - and that is what gave FT4 the same treatment.

 * "reserve" was never a free parameter - it was the signal end plus an RX
 * latency guard, written down from the FT8 end of the arithmetic and therefore
 * unusable for any other slot length. Expressed the other way round it applies
 * to both protocols unchanged:
 *
 *     cut = ft8_gate_burst_ms(is_ft4) + FT8_RX_LATENCY_GUARD_MS
 *     FT8: 12640 + 560 = 13200   <- bit-identical to the old constant
 *     FT4:  5040 + 560 =  5600

 * The guard is a WALL-CLOCK quantity - our own audio-path latency plus however

// 2026-06-30: this constant was being applied to FT4 too (decode_slot()

// vs 15 s) so the resend-timing pressure that motivated the FT8 cut doesn't
// even apply the same way, and FT4's LDPC code (different parity matrix)
// apparently needs more headroom to converge than FT8's. Split into a

 * monitor's waterfall. Hardware-captured 2026-09-01 on v1.10.5 - a Load access
 * fault in estimate_snr_db (ft8_lib decode.c:471) reading block[bin], MTVAL a
 * garbage pointer, 20 s AFTER `ft8_task exiting` had already logged.
 *
 * This is the rule the rest of the teardown already follows and this one path
 * ignored: reap_pending_tasks() deliberately reaps nothing on a join timeout,
 * and the worker context is deliberately LEAKED with the comment "a small leak
 * beats a crash". The pool is the same trade at a larger size - two waterfalls
 * (163 KB each in FT8, 82 KB in FT4) plus scratch, in PSRAM, where there are
 * ~15 MB free, and only on a pathological timeout.
 *
 * The next FT8 entry builds a fresh pool because every pointer here is NULL.
 *
 * ⚠ Do NOT "fix" the underlying starvation by widening the 15 s wait. The
 * worker is tskIDLE_PRIORITY+1 on core 0, and returning to the panadapter puts
 * taskLVGL back on that core at ~74 % - the log showed `idle0 0.0%` at the
 * moment of the fault. A longer bound changes the odds, not the race; this

 * Reaping a WithCaps task (#279)
 *
 * Every task in this file is created with xTaskCreatePinnedToCoreWithCaps() so
 * its 32-64 KB stack comes from PSRAM. Such a task MUST be freed with
 * vTaskDeleteWithCaps(); a plain vTaskDelete() leaves the stack and TCB
 * allocated for ever, which IDF says outright in idf_additions.c: "the idle
 * task will not free the task TCB and stack memories we created statically
 * during xTaskCreateWithCaps() ... Therefore, it will leak memory."
 *
 * That was measured here, not inferred: three Panadapter/WSPR round trips took
 * PSRAM 15153 -> 14946 -> 14540 -> 14498 KB, about 218 KB per FT8 exit - the
 * 160 KB of stacks plus the shared FFT scratch. Roughly 70 mode toggles would
 * exhaust free PSRAM, and the symptom would be FT8 quietly refusing to start.
 *
 * ⛔ THE OBVIOUS FIX IS WORSE THAN THE BUG. Calling vTaskDeleteWithCaps(NULL)
 * on yourself makes IDF spawn a temporary cleanup task to do the freeing, from
 * INTERNAL RAM, and abort() if it cannot get it. A task-create failure from
 * internal RAM is not hypothetical on this board - it is what we had just
 * finished watching happen 390 times - and an abort() is a warm reset, which
 * with the radio attached is the documented #74 QMX wedge. That trades a slow
 * leak for a reboot that kills the operator's radio.
 *
 * So a finished task PARKS itself and registers its handle here, and an owner
 * reaps it from an ordinary context. vTaskDeleteWithCaps() called on ANOTHER
 * task suspends the target, spins until it is provably not eRunning, deletes
 * it and frees the buffers - no temporary task, no abort, nothing to fail.

         * and answers someone else. The fix was written for exactly that in
         * v1.0.0 and then switched off for the mode he uses, on the assumption
         * that a 7.5 s slot has no room to wait.
         *
         * The arithmetic says otherwise:
         *     FT8  15.0 s slot - 12.64 s burst (79 x 160 ms) = 2.36 s of room
         *     FT4   7.5 s slot -  5.04 s burst (105 x 48 ms) = 2.46 s of room
         * FT4 has MORE room, not less, because its burst shrinks faster than its
         * slot does. The existing 2300 ms deadline is that room minus a margin,
         * and it is comfortably safe for both.
         *
         * Safe by construction either way: if the decode has not landed by the
         * deadline the armed message fires anyway, so the worst case is exactly
         * today's behaviour - a repeat - and never a skipped slot.
         *
         * ⚠ HONEST LIMIT: an FT4 decode measures ~2.3 s, which is right at the
         * deadline, so this will help on the faster slots and do nothing on the
         * slower ones. It is not a promise that the repeat disappears. */

                 * tail was captured before the decode could even be queued.
                 * Decode then takes ~2 s, landing ~2000 ms into the next slot
                 * against a hold deadline of 2060 ms. Every FT4 reply was
                 * arriving within 60 ms of missing its slot - a structural
                 * one-cycle-late risk, not bad luck.
                 *
                 * Cutting at 5600 ms queues the decode 1900 ms earlier, which
                 * lands it ~100 ms into the next slot instead of ~2000.
                 *
                 * Safe by the same mechanism FT8 already relies on: a short
                 * capture simply yields a shorter waterfall. monitor_process()
                 * counts the blocks it stored into wf.num_blocks, and every

    // 1 Hz respawn watchdog in ft8_screen_view.c, both need it to mean "an
    // ft8_task EXISTS". Between those two readings sits the whole scheduling
    // delay, and ft8_task is created at tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 1: the LOWEST
    // priority on the board. On a busy core - capture, fft_task (4), taskLVGL,
    // the feeds (2) and httpd (5) all above it - taking more than a second to
    // get its first slice is ordinary, not exceptional. The same starvation is
    // measured directly in ft8_screen.c's record_decode comment.
    //
    // So the FT8-entry path spawned the task, the watchdog looked one second
    // later, saw a flag still false, logged "no ft8_task alive - respawning"
    // and spawned a SECOND one. Both then built the monitor pool - four
    // "Block size" lines where one build emits two - and the second build
    // double-freed the shared FFT scratch: `assert failed: tlsf_free ... block
    // already marked as free`, ft8_task -> build_monitor_pool -> free(). That
    // is almost certainly the unreproduced tlsf_free double-free reboot open
    // since v1.3.0.
    //
    // Setting the flag here closes the window by construction rather than by
    // timing: a grace period in the watchdog would only have made the race
    // rarer, and this file's history is emphatic that timing changes the odds
    // of a race, not the race.
