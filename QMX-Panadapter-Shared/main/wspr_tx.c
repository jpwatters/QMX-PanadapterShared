 * cycle with a TX switch on it: the operator would arm TX, watch the burst run,
 * and never be spotted by anybody. A control that reports success and does
 * nothing is the worst outcome available.
 *
 * The on-air proof came from commit 3db70a8 ("ON THE AIR - 50 spots worldwide,
 * zero drift, all fields correct"), which was built with this flipped locally
 * while the committed source stayed at 0 - so the evidence and the default
 * disagreed for weeks without anyone noticing.

    // Measured, first hardware dry run (2026-08-23, 162 symbols, with FT8
    // capturing and decoding concurrently, i.e. worst case): at
    // tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 1 the worker sat below fft_task (4), cat_poll and
    // cat_link (5) and audio_task (6), and 15 of 162 symbols went out late -
    // 7 of them by more than 30 ms, worst 66 ms, each one coinciding with an
    // ordinary FT8-capture or USB-transport slice. That is the same
    // lowest-priority starvation CLAUDE.md's #199 note describes.

    // 5 puts it with the CAT tasks, which is where it belongs - it IS a CAT
    // burst, and cat_poll is paused for its whole duration anyway. It stays
    // strictly BELOW audio_task (6) so the USB isochronous pump keeps its
    // margin: see #51, where losing that margin cost 170-350 ms of audio a
    // slot, silently, at the wire.
