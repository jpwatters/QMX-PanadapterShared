// BLE HID mouse - Stage 1: bring the stack up and SCAN.
//
// Why a mouse over Bluetooth at all: the QMX owns the ESP32-P4's single USB
// host. A USB mouse therefore needs a hub, and a hub puts both devices behind
// a Transaction Translator that ESP-IDF 5.4.4 does not implement - hardware
// -proven, both ports get disabled (see CLAUDE.md, "USB mouse"). BLE touches
// none of that, so it is the only way to have a pointer AND the radio at once,
// which is the case that actually matters in the field.
//
// The controller is on the C6 and HCI rides the SAME SDIO link as WiFi. That
// link is this board's most fragile component by a wide margin (the whole
// esp_hosted wedge history in CLAUDE.md), so STAGE 1 DELIBERATELY STOPS AT
// SCANNING: bring up NimBLE, scan, log what is nearby, and let a soak answer
// "does BLE coexist with WiFi here?" BEFORE any pairing or report-handling
// code exists to muddy the question. Connecting is Stage 2.
//
// Static cost measured before writing a line of this: enabling BT moved .bss
// by +96 bytes (156,780 -> 156,876), because the controller is not ours and
// NimBLE takes its pools from the heap. The runtime heap cost is the real
// number and is logged at init below.
//
// WITH bt_mouse_en OFF THE COST IS ZERO, and this was checked rather than
// assumed. I spent an evening warning that CONFIG_BT_ENABLED changes the
// host<->C6 handshake for every user, on the strength of a boot line reading
// "vhci_drv: Host BT Support: Enabled". It does not:
//   * hci_drv_init() for VHCI is literally an empty function;
//   * hci_drv_show_configuration() is two ESP_LOGI calls;
//   * hci_rx_handler() only runs when HCI data arrives, and none does unless
//     NimBLE is started and sends a command first;
//   * the "capabilities: 0xd / HCI over SDIO / BLE only" report appears in
//     NON-BT builds too - verified against a v1.6.0-era boot log. That is the
//     C6 announcing its own features, unprompted.
// So the only difference for a user who never ticks the box is ~71 KB of
// dormant flash. Read the function before inferring behaviour from its log.
