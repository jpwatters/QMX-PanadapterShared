// v0.13.0: FT8 QSO state machine — auto search-and-pounce + CQ-run.
//
// Driven from two call sites:
//   ft8_qso_start()       – LVGL task (core 0): arm TX1, enter WAIT_RPT (pounce)
//   ft8_qso_start_cq()    – LVGL task (core 0): arm CQ, enter CQ (run)
//   ft8_qso_advance()     – ft8_decode_task (core 1): after each RX slot, scan
//                           decodes, decide the next message, time out / retry
//   ft8_qso_on_tx_complete() – ft8_task (core 1): right after a burst ends,
//                           re-arm the current outgoing message for the next
//                           matching slot (CQ loop cadence + exchange retries)
//
// Two roles share one machine:
//   POUNCE  (we answered their CQ): TX1 grid → WAIT_RPT → R-rpt → WAIT_RR73 → 73
//   CQ-RUN  (they answered our CQ): CQ → answer → report → WAIT_ROGER → RR73
//
// The "current outgoing message" is re-armed every TX slot until the expected
// reply is heard (progress) or QSO_TIMEOUT_SLOTS consecutive RX slots pass with
// none (timeout). This is what keeps us patiently re-sending instead of going
// silent after one transmission.

 * until it is cleared. Operator, 2026-09-02: "it blocks new processes."
 *
 * ft8_qso_timeout_expire_check() clears it once it is 20 s old and returns
 * whether it did. Safe from any task and idempotent, so it can be called from
 * both the 1 Hz UI timer (which gives it second accuracy) and the decode task's
 * advance() (which covers a browser-only session). Tapping still clears it at
 * once.
 *
