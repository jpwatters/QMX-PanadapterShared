// Live spots on the spectrum: stations currently on the air, drawn at their
// frequency under the trace so you can see who is where without leaving the
// radio.
//
// Source-agnostic by design. POTA (api.pota.app, a plain JSON GET) is the
// first source; RBN is intended as a second one feeding the SAME store, so
// the display layer never has to know where a spot came from - and a
// misbehaving source can be dropped without losing the feature. SOTA arrives
// the same way, from spothole.app (see spots.c), and DX cluster spots from
// net/dxcluster.c.
//
// Threading: one background fetch task (PSRAM stack, low priority) owns the
// network side and publishes into a mutex-protected store. The UI reads a
// snapshot from the LVGL thread and never blocks on the network.
