 * (1280x200) together account for ~7.3 Mpx/s, which matches the LOW readings -
 * but the same screen at the SAME rate also reads 16-20 Mpx/s, i.e. about 1.5
 * whole screens per frame. Something other than the two big canvases is
 * invalidating roughly 10 Mpx/s and nothing had looked at it.
 *
 * So the pixels are bucketed by where they land. Attribution by y is enough
 * because this screen is six stacked full-width panels, and it stays O(1) per
 * event - one compare chain, no walk (the cyan-flash rule applies here too).
 *
 * ⛔ THE BAND EDGES MIRROR ui.c's LAYOUT #defines and cannot include them
 * (display.c is below the UI, not above it). If the panel heights change there,
 * these move or the attribution lies. They are asserted against DISPLAY_V_RES
 * at init, which catches a total that stops adding up but not a redistribution.
 * Bands, in ui.c's terms: TOP_BAR_H 60, SPECTRUM_H 200, LABEL_BAR_H 32,

     *
     * This has been `buff_spiram = 1` since Phase 6.2, which puts the entire
     * hot path in PSRAM: the two canvases are blitted from PSRAM into a PSRAM
     * draw buffer, that draw buffer is then read STRIDED by LVGL's
     * rotate90_rgb565 (one 128-byte cache line fetched per 2-byte pixel), and
     * the result written to the PSRAM framebuffer. Three full-screen passes per
     * frame, all through the L2 cache, all on core 0 - where taskLVGL measures
     * 73.9%.
     *
     * Neutering the rotation recovered only ~7 of those points, which is the
     * clue: the strided read is expensive BECAUSE its source is PSRAM. From
     * internal SRAM there are no cache lines to fill, so both the blit
     * destination and the rotation source get dramatically cheaper.
     *
     * It costs internal RAM we did not have until now - and that is the join
     * between #284 and #285: halving the L2 cache returns 128 KB of exactly the
     * memory this needs. Two buffers at 16 lines is ~80 KB.
     *
     * ⚠ HYPOTHESIS, NOT A CONCLUSION. Four theories about core 0 were falsified
     * on hardware on 2026-08-28 alone, so this is selectable at RUNTIME and
     * defaults to the long-standing behaviour. `{"action":"gfx_exp",
     * "internal":true,"lines":16}` stores the choice and reboots, so an A/B
     * costs a reboot rather than a rebuild.
     *
     * ⛔ The size is checked against the LARGEST FREE BLOCK before asking, not
     * after failing: bsp_display_start_with_config() returning NULL aborts the
     * boot inside ESP_ERROR_CHECK, and retrying it after a partial init would
     * be worse than not trying. If the memory is not there we log and stay on

    /* ⭐ 15/15, not 12/15, since 2026-10-06. The comment above chose 12 to keep
     * something in reserve "in case something ever genuinely needs the last
     * word". Something does: the operator sees the SAME dropped-frame blank on
     * every waterfall row shift ("super short black screen then the carpet
     * again"), at 3 rows/s and at 30, and it predates this session (verified by
     * reproducing it on c5474b2).
     *
     * A row shift is the largest PSRAM burst this board runs: 474 kpx redrawn
     * through LVGL's software 90-degree rotation, which traverses the strip
     * COLUMN by column out of PSRAM, ~20 strips per shift, into a framebuffer
     * that is itself PSRAM while the DSI fetches from it continuously. Exactly
     * the starvation this QoS field exists to prevent - same fault class as the
     * cyan flash, different trigger.
     *
     * ⚠ TESTED, AND IT IS NOT THE FIX. Operator at 15/15: "blink is probably a
     * little bit less - but it is definitely still there". Treat that as
     * suggestive and UNMEASURED, not as confirmation: DSI starvation is at most
     * a contributor. Kept anyway because the reserve it gives up was itself
     * speculative ("in case something ever genuinely needs the last word") and
     * the DSI fetch is the one client that must never miss a window - bounded
     * at ~110 MB/s of a >600 MB/s budget, as the note above measured.
     *

    /* ⛔ OPEN BUG: THE WATERFALL BLANKS FOR ONE FRAME ON EVERY ROW SHIFT.
     *
     * Operator, 2026-10-06: "the whole carpet kind of blinking - not flashing -
     * but like super short black screen then the carpet again", every row shift
     * or every second one. PRE-EXISTING: reproduced on c5474b2 with none of
     * this session's work present. Independent of the row rate (3 rows/s and
     * 30 both do it).
     *
     * Ruled out by test, not by argument:
     *   - the per-row lv_canvas_set_buffer() teardown, which drops the image
     *     cache twice and re-sets the source every row (removed in 86bf5d6 -
     *     the blink did not change)
     *   - DSI arbiter starvation as the SOLE cause (this QoS line - at most a
     *     small improvement)
     *
     * What is left is how a frame reaches the panel. This display runs partial
     * draw buffers + double buffering + LVGL SOFTWARE rotation into a PSRAM
     * framebuffer that the DSI reads continuously - and this BSP cannot avoid
     * tearing in that configuration at all: m5stack_tab5.c forces
     * `.sw_rotate = false` under CONFIG_BSP_DISPLAY_LVGL_AVOID_TEAR, with the
     * comment "Avoid tearing is not supported for SW rotation". So the panel
     * can latch a framebuffer region while it is still being rewritten, and a
     * row shift rewrites the entire 1280x370 carpet as ~11 strips.
     *
     * ⚠ MEASURE FIRST. Time the flush callback and count strips per row
     * shift; do not reach for CONFIG_BSP_DISPLAY_LVGL_FULL_REFRESH on reasoning
     * alone - it costs MORE PSRAM traffic, which is the opposite direction to
     * what the QoS result hints at, and it forces a full rebuild. Two
     * hypotheses have already been spent here without a measurement. */
