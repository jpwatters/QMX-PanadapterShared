// LoTW (ARRL Logbook of the World) upload — signs logged QSOs into a TQ8
// file on-device and POSTs it to https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw/upload.
//
// Unlike QRZ/eQSL there is no account login: the TQ8 payload is
// self-authenticating (each QSO carries an RSA-SHA1 signature made with the
// user's LoTW callsign-certificate private key). The cert + key arrive via
// the web UI's p12 import (parsed browser-side, POSTed as base64 DER) and
// live on SPIFFS. Progress is tracked the same way as qrz/eqsl_upload.c:
// a plain count (lotw_uploaded_n), since adif_log.c only ever appends.
