//
// ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS. Plain import deduplicates on exactly the three fields a
// correction does NOT change, so a record fixed in an external logger is by
// construction a "duplicate" and is skipped - the wrong version stays and the
// report says "duplicate", which reads like "already fine". Gyula HA3HZ hit
// this twice: first the restore direction did not exist at all, then it existed
// and silently refused his corrections ("The corrected file cannot be
// installed, the previous incorrect version remains"). An import that cannot
// carry a correction is not a way to fix a log.
//
// ⚠ Three consequences, all deliberate and all stated to the operator:
//  - The match key is CALL+QSO_DATE+TIME_ON, so those three can never be
//    corrected this way. A record with a wrong date is a different record.
//  - Replaced records move to the END of the file. Records are only ever
//    appended, so a rewrite in place would be new machinery for a cosmetic
//    property; the log viewer sorts on the columns anyway.
//  - Upload cursors step back past the removed records, so a corrected QSO is
//    sent to QRZ/eQSL/LoTW again. That is the right direction - the remote copy
//    is the one carrying the wrong grid - and all three dedupe server-side.
//
// Two passes, both O(N): one adif_log_delete_matching() rewrite to take the
// stale versions out (which is what keeps the cursors honest), then the normal
// append. Never loop a per-record delete here - see #325.

//
// This exists because the backup was previously one-way. Gyula HA3HZ lost his
