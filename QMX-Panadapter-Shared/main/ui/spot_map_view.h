// Ported by him from his own rbn_monitor project. What changed on the way
// in - the spot map being opt-in rather than always running - is in the
// merge commit and in settings.h under spotmap_en.

// shared Mode/Quelle filter sidebar that both tabs read. Opened by swiping
// down from the top screen edge (see ui.c's top_edge_swipe_cb) - modelled on
// reader_view.c's overlay pattern (full-screen child of the LVGL screen,
// hidden/foregrounded rather than created and destroyed per open).
