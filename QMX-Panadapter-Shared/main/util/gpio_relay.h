// Remote GPIO relay pulse - Randy N4OPI's request (2026-09-04): most of his
// QMXs already carry a 2.5mm jack wired to PWR_ON/GND so a home-automation
// relay can power them on/off, and a remote Tab5 firmware upgrade needs a
// manual QMX power cycle afterward (see CLAUDE.md's #74) - which defeats the
// point of doing the upgrade remotely if there is nobody at the bench to flip
// the switch. This drives a Tab5 GPIO to trigger that same relay.
//
// ⛔ WHITELISTED TO EXACTLY TWO PINS, GPIO53/54 - not "any GPIO you ask for".
// Both are genuinely free: BSP_EXT_I2C_SDA/SCL in the m5stack_tab5 BSP header,
// which nothing on this board currently uses (the snap-on keyboard's I2C is
// GPIO0/1 - a DIFFERENT bus, see keyboard/tab5_keyboard.c - and
// BSP_POWER_AMP_IO, historically GPIO53, is disabled/GPIO_NUM_NC in the BSP
// as shipped). An arbitrary-pin API from the web would be a real hazard on a
// board this densely wired; these two are the only ones with nothing else on
// them.

// Call once at boot, AFTER settings_init(). Configures both whitelisted pins
// as outputs resting on the INACTIVE side of the stored polarity - open-relay
// is the safe default, and a contact closure must require a deliberate pulse.//
// ⛔ This used to rest both pins at a fixed LOW, which for an operator who had
// chosen active LOW meant the relay was held CLOSED from boot until the first
// pulse released it (Randy N4OPI, 2026-09-06). "Resting" is a statement about

// brought up by the caller AFTER this returns.

// clamping silently does something other than what was asked); or a pulse on
