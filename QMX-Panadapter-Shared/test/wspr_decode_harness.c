/* Host test for the WSPR audio-domain decoder (main/wspr_decode.c) against
 * a REAL captured WSPR WAV file - the actual Phase 1 deliverable per
 * docs/wspr-scope.md: "Get this decoding real, known signals correctly
 * before it ever touches the device."
 *
 * Build (from the repo root):
 *   gcc -O2 -Wall -I main -I components/ft8_lib \
 *       -o wspr_decode_harness test/wspr_decode_harness.c \
 *       main/wspr_proto.c main/wspr_fano.c main/wspr_decode.c \

 *
 * WAV: test/wav_reference/wspr/150426_0918.wav - WSJT's own official WSPR
 * sample recording (sourceforge.net/projects/wsjt/files/samples/WSPR/),
 * 120 s / 12000 Hz / 16-bit mono, the standard WSPR RX capture format.
 * Tracked in git like every other file under test/wav_reference/ (not a
 * copyrighted vendor manual - a small, freely-distributed WSJT project
 * sample file, same status as the existing FT8 reference WAVs).
 *
 * GROUND TRUTH. This file's actual transmitted content isn't documented
 * anywhere findable - there's no "here's what 150426_0918.wav decodes to"
 * reference page. What stands in for ground truth here: five of the eight
 * detected candidate frequencies decode to standard-format US amateur
 * callsigns (W3HH, WD4LHT, ND6P, W5BIT, KI7CI), each with a legal WSPR
 * power value and a clean Fano convergence (82-102 cycles, vs 49400-78894
 * for the three rejected candidates) - three independent signals that all
 * agree. That is real corroboration, not proof against an authoritative
 * source; if this file's true content is ever found published, replace
 * this comment and tighten the assertions.
 *
 * The file's own STRONGEST signal (by a 3x margin) does NOT decode
 * plausibly - RESOLVED (test/wspr_diag_candidate0.c, docs/wspr-phase1-
 * status.md): real ionospheric fading (QSB) within the transmission, not
 * a bug - confirmed frequency drift was NOT the cause, then found the
 * signal's sync-bit match rate climbs from ~52-63% to 81-89% and its
 * total power rises ~20x over the 110s transmission, both textbook QSB,
 * with no second overlapping signal (a +/-3Hz scan shows one clean peak).
 * A uniform-confidence metric can't recover ~46/162 symbol errors
 * concentrated in the noisy first half even though the signal is real -
 * fixing this needs PER-SYMBOL (not per-capture) confidence weighting, a
 * genuinely different idea from the soft-metric attempts tried so far.
 * The regression test below asserts the 5 that DO work, and separately
 * checks that exactly 3 are rejected, so a future fix for this candidate
 * shows up as an easy "6th decode appeared" rather than a silent behavior
 * change
 * nobody notices.
