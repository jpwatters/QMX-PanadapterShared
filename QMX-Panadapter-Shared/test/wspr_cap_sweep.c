/* How many WSPR stations does our decoder find if the CANDIDATE CAP is lifted?
 *
 * Build (from the repo root):
 *   gcc -O2 -Wall -I main -I components/ft8_lib -o wspr_cap_sweep \
 *       test/wspr_cap_sweep.c main/wspr_proto.c main/wspr_fano.c \
 *       main/wspr_decode.c main/wspr_subtract.c \
 *       components/ft8_lib/fft/kiss_fft.c \
 *       components/ft8_lib/fft/kiss_fftr.c -lm
 *   ./wspr_cap_sweep test/wav_reference/wspr/260824_1906.wav [max_cands]
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *   The device ran with WSPR_MAX_CANDS = 8 and every one of its first 127
 *   cycles reported exactly 8 - the cap was saturated 100 % of the time, so
 *   "8 candidates" read like a measurement while being a ceiling. wsprd finds
 *   32 stations across the three 2026-08-24 reference windows where the device
 *   found 10.
 *
 *   That leaves two candidate explanations which the device CANNOT separate,
 *   because on hardware the decode has to fit inside a 120 s cycle:
 *     (a) the cap - the stations were never TRIED, or
 *     (b) the ranking - they were tried and our decoder cannot decode them.
 *   Here there is no time limit, so trying every candidate answers it directly.
 *
 * Links the REAL decoder. The algorithm is untouched by the cap change; the
 * only variable is how many candidates get a chance.
