"""Fail the build when a standing patch is missing.

WHY THIS EXISTS (TODO #181, written 2026-08-17 the same evening it was needed):

Three patches had silently vanished from `managed_components/` - a git-ignored
directory, so nothing in the repo could show it - and the resulting binary wedged
WiFi within about four minutes of every boot. The symptom is indistinguishable
from a hardware fault: the device stays completely healthy (no reboot, no panic,
audio still streaming) while the C6 co-processor stops answering. It cost an
evening and TWO wrong hypotheses (BLE scanning, then DMA starvation) before anyone
thought to check whether the patches were still applied.

The only thing that had ever said "re-apply them" was the release process. A plain
`idf.py build` would happily produce that broken binary, which is the gap this
closes.

TWO RULES FOR THIS FILE:

  1. The markers below are the SAME strings each apply_*.ps1 script tests for its
     own idempotency. Do not invent a different marker here - if the two ever
     disagree, this check starts lying, and a check that lies about patches is
     worse than no check at all. When a patch script's marker changes, change it
     here in the same commit.

     For the two USB patches that cannot log (#7 and #8) the marker is the
     COUNTER SYMBOL, not a date comment. Those patches turn an abort() into a
     survivable error silently, so a tolerant-but-silent version of them is
     indistinguishable from no patch at all in a diag log - it must not pass this
     check. Testing for the symbol makes "patched" mean "patched AND observable"
     (TODO #189).

  2. Missing patches are an ERROR, never a warning. A warning scrolls past in a
     long IDF build, which is exactly how it would go unnoticed again.

A missing FILE is only a warning: the managed_components tree may legitimately not
be fetched yet on the very first configure, and the IDF-tree patches live outside
this repo entirely (they are per-build-machine, wiped by an IDF reinstall). It is a
present-but-unpatched file that means trouble.
