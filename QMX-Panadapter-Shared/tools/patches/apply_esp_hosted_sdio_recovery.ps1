.SYNOPSIS
    Re-applies the QMX-Panadapter esp_hosted SDIO "oversize-length recovery" patch.

.DESCRIPTION
    managed_components/ is git-ignored and is wiped by `idf.py fullclean` or a
    dependency refresh (the release process runs `rm -r managed_components/`).
    This script re-applies the patch to esp_hosted's SDIO host driver that stops
    a permanent WiFi wedge.

    THE BUG: in RX_NONE mode (CONFIG_ESP_HOSTED_SDIO_OPTIMIZATION_RX_NONE=y) the
    host RX task computes a rolling "pending bytes" delta from the slave (C6). If
    that delta ever exceeds ESP_RX_BUFFER_SIZE (1536) -- which happens
    intermittently under WiFi load, and on long idle uptimes -- the stock driver
    logged "H_SDIO_DRV: Len from slave[N] exceeds max [1536]", returned ESP_FAIL,
    and the RX task skipped the interrupt WITHOUT reading the bytes or advancing
    its byte counter. The identical oversized delta then recurred on every
    subsequent interrupt forever -> the SDIO link livelocked -> every RPC to the
    C6 (e.g. the 1 Hz WifiStaGetApInfo 0x126 poll) timed out permanently. WiFi
    "died" with FT8/CAT unaffected; only a reboot recovered it.

    THE FIX (in sdio_drv.c): remove the return-ESP_FAIL guard from
    sdio_get_len_from_slave() (it now always returns the raw delta), and have the
    RX task, on an oversized delta, DRAIN+DISCARD the pending bytes in
    <=ESP_RX_BUFFER_SIZE block-padded chunks (identical CMD53 addressing to the
    normal read) and advance sdio_rx_byte_count so the delta re-aligns. One frame
    is lost (TCP/UDP retransmits) but the link survives. A diagnostic
    "SDIO RX oversize: len=.. host_cnt=.. slave_reg=.." line is logged each time.
    Verified on hardware: the recovery fired and WiFi stayed fully up (no 0x126).

    This ships as a byte-exact copy of the patched file (the patch is multi-hunk;
    a store/restore is far more reliable than reconstructing string edits). A
    version guard refuses to clobber anything that isn't the known-pristine
    esp_hosted 1.4.0 sdio_drv.c.

    Idempotent: running it twice is a no-op. Run after every clean fetch of the
    managed components, before building.
