.SYNOPSIS
    Stops cdc_acm_host_close() abort()-rebooting the device when an endpoint
    still has a URB in flight. Retries the interface release first, then logs
    and continues instead of asserting.

.DESCRIPTION
    Stock cdc_acm_host.c (v2.x) ends cdc_acm_host_close() with:

        ESP_ERROR_CHECK(usb_host_interface_release(..., data.intf_desc->bInterfaceNumber));
        ...
        ESP_ERROR_CHECK(usb_host_interface_release(..., notif.intf_desc->bInterfaceNumber));

    usb_host_interface_release() returns ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE if ANY endpoint
    of the interface still has num_urb_inflight != 0 or is on the pending list.
    It gives the client task exactly vTaskDelay(10) to reap flushed URBs - and
    at this project's CONFIG_FREERTOS_HZ=1000 that is 10 MILLISECONDS, not the
    100 ms the vendor comment reads like. So a busy port turns a transient into
    abort(), i.e. a full device reboot.

    Serial-captured on the Tab5 while adding the QMX terminal (#147,
    2026-08-16): closing a session on the radio's second CDC interface aborted
    at cdc_acm_host.c:717 with 0x103 ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE. Timing tweaks on our
    side (a non-blocking RX callback, waiting for the port to go quiet) made it
    rarer - three clean closes then an abort on the fourth - which is exactly
    the shape of a race rather than a bug that timing can fix.

    Worse, the reboot is a Tab5 warm reset with the QMX attached, which is the
    documented #74 trigger, so every abort also wedged the radio until a power
    cycle.

    This patch does two things, in order of preference:
      1. RETRIES the release (16 x 20 ms) - this addresses the actual cause,
         which is that IDF's 10 ms allowance is too short when the client task
         is busy. Nearly always succeeds on a later attempt.
      2. Only if it still fails, logs a warning and carries on, so the device
         object is always freed and the firmware never dies. The interface claim
         is leaked in that case - a leak is strictly better than a reboot, and
         it mirrors the precedent already set by this project's UAC fork
         ("forced teardown on a dead device", see CLAUDE.md).

    The same treatment is applied to the two endpoint resets above it, which
    fail for the same reason on a device that has already gone away.

    ⚠ This edits managed_components/, which is git-ignored and is WIPED by
    `idf.py fullclean`, a dependency refresh, and the release process's
    `rm -r managed_components/`. Re-run it after any of those, like the other
    apply_*.ps1 patches.

    Idempotent: running it twice is a no-op.
