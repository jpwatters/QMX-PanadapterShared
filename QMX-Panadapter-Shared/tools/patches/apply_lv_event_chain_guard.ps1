# Re-apply the lv_event chain guard (#329) to managed_components/.
#
# managed_components/ is git-ignored and is wiped by `idf.py fullclean`, a
# dependency refresh, and the release process's `rm -r managed_components/` -
# so this restores the patched file the same store/restore way as
# apply_esp_hosted_sdio_recovery.ps1. Idempotent, marker-guarded.
#
# WHAT IT DOES: lv_event_mark_deleted() walks the in-flight event chain on
# every object destruction. Twice on 2026-09-06 that walk read a link that was
# not a pointer (0x6a9d5caa, then 0x0000ffff) and the device took a Load access
# fault on taskLVGL. The guard stops walking and counts instead of dying.
# Diagnostic, not a cure - it comes out when the cause is understood.
