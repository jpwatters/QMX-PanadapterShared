# bench_watchdog.ps1 - keep the serial captures alive, without supervision.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   The capture is the only record of a crash. CLAUDE.md's serial rule 10 says
#   a dead capture looks EXACTLY like a quiet, healthy device, and rule 11 says
#   one started from a tool call gets killed - which is why captures run as
#   scheduled tasks. But that task is `/sc once`: it starts the capture, and if
#   the capture ever dies, nothing brings it back.
#
#   It died on 2026-09-12 during a flash and stayed dead for 22 minutes. The
#   operator hit a complete UI freeze in that window and there was no log of it
#   at all. His words: "you simply need to fix that capture once and for all
#   ... i do not need to hear after a crasch that it was not captured."
#
#   So this runs every minute and restarts any capture that has stopped
#   producing output. It is deliberately dumb: it never reasons about WHY the
#   capture stopped, it just notices that the file is not growing.
#
# ⛔ WHAT IT MUST NOT DO
#   Restart a capture during a flash. bench.ps1 stops the capture on purpose
#   there, and re-opening the port mid-write would be the COM9-held-through-a-
#   flash incident of 2026-09-09 all over again. The bench LOCK is the
#   interlock: bench flash holds it for the whole operation, so this skips
#   entirely while it is held.
#
#   Reopening a port also resets the Tab5 (documented, non-deterministic), and
#   a warm reset with the radio attached is the #74 QMX wedge - so a restart is
#   not free. That is the price of having a record at all, and it is only paid
#   when the capture is genuinely dead, never on a whim.

# ⛔ A STALE FILE CAN COEXIST WITH A GENUINELY-ALIVE PROCESS, AND THAT WAS THE
# WHOLE BUG. Found 2026-09-12 after `bench capture dev` correctly reported
# "already running" against a process that had produced NOTHING for 6.5 hours
# straight, one watchdog cycle every minute, all of them logging "restart
# produced NO output" within 8-9 seconds - too fast for the internal 20-40 s
# retry loop bench.ps1's Cmd-Capture runs when it actually tries to start
# something. That timing is the tell: Cmd-Capture was hitting its OWN
# "already running - leave it alone" early return every single time, because a
# process genuinely was alive - just stuck.
#
# The likely mechanism (consistent with the timeline: the device was frozen,
# then flashed and rebooted, and the failures continued for hours afterward
# regardless): SerialPort.Open()/Read() against a COM port backed by a
# USB-CDC device that has since reset can BLOCK INDEFINITELY on the OS side
# rather than throwing - so the capture script's own try/catch/reconnect logic
# (which is otherwise correct) never gets a chance to run, because the thread
# never returns from the blocking call. Task Scheduler's `/end` cannot reach
# it either: `/end` only knows about the wscript.exe process it launched, and
# wscript already exited the instant it started the detached capture (that is
# the whole point of run_hidden.vbs - see its own header). The capture process
# is an orphan from Task Scheduler's point of view from the moment it starts.
#
# So bench.ps1's "is a process already running" check is the RIGHT question
# for a human running `bench capture` (never clobber a healthy one), and the
# WRONG question for a watchdog, whose entire job is to find a process that is
# alive but not doing its job. Staleness of the FILE, not existence of the
# PROCESS, is the watchdog's ground truth - so on a stale file it kills
# whatever is holding the port BEFORE asking bench.ps1 to start a fresh one,
# every time, regardless of what Get-CaptureProcess would have said.
