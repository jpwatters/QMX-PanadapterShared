// FT8 pileup tracker — manual-only "who's called me and I haven't worked
// yet" list. Populated passively from decode traffic (see ft8_qso.c's
// capture_pileup_callers(), called every decode cycle regardless of state)
// and surfaced via ft8_pileup_modal.c so the operator can go back and work
// someone who called during a busy CQ-run, even after they've stopped
// transmitting and aged out of the live decode list (ft8_screen.c ages rows
// out after FT8_ROW_STALE_SEC=120s; this list survives far longer than that,
// swept only past PILEUP_MAX_AGE_S in ft8_pileup.c — an entry otherwise
// leaves when worked, manually dismissed, evicted for space, or a band
// change makes it moot (see ft8_band_change_stand_down()).
//
// Deliberately NOT automatic: nothing in this module ever arms a TX. Tapping
// an entry in the UI goes through the exact same ft8_tx_modal_show()
// confirmation flow as tapping a live decode-list row.
