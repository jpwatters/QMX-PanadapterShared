 * The Tab5 has no keyboard unless the snap-on one is fitted, so a menu field that
 * wants a value typed into it was unreachable from the device - the browser had a
 * real keyboard and the Tab5 had arrows. Randy asked for this and it was
 * deliberately held back: "it waits behind the cursor and delete work - a keyboard
 * is not much use typing into a field you cannot see." Both of those now work, so
 * this is unblocked rather than merely wanted.
 *
 * Note the deliberate difference from every other keyboard in this firmware: it is
 * attached to NO textarea. Each press is forwarded straight to the radio as a
 * keystroke, because the radio's own menu owns the field and its cursor - there is
 * no local copy of the text to edit, and inventing one would immediately disagree
 * with what the radio shows.
