// Step 4c.2 v0.10: FT8 decode aggregation - data layer.
//
// 4c.1: data layer built. Each decoded message is parsed for its
//       remote callsign (2nd token by FT8 message convention) and
//       merged into a fixed-size table, keyed by that callsign.
// 4c.2: LVGL list widget (ft8_screen_view) snapshots this table
//       at slot end. A mutex now guards table access (writer =
//       ft8_task on core 1, readers = LVGL timer on core 0).
