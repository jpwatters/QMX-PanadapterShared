/* A terminal session on the QMX's SECOND serial port.
 *
 * WHY PORT 2. The QMX manual is explicit that closing a terminal session without
 * choosing "Exit terminal" leaves the radio refusing CAT commands. On the shared
 * port that would kill the panadapter. Measured 2026-08-16: with "USB serial
 * ports" set to 2 the radio's second CDC function starts at INTERFACE 5, our USB
 * host opens it, and CAT keeps polling on interface 0 throughout. So a session
 * here cannot take the panadapter down even if it ends badly.
 *
 * The extra port is off by default and is itself settable over CAT
 * (System config|GPS & Ser. ports|USB serial ports), which is what makes this
 * usable on a HEADLESS QMX+ - otherwise enabling the port would require the menu
 * that the terminal exists to reach.

/* Leave terminal mode PROPERLY and close the port. Safe to call when not open.

 * This drives the radio's own "Exit terminal" menu item rather than just
 * dropping the connection, because dropping it is precisely what the manual
 * warns against. It reads the screen to find the item instead of sending a
 * fixed number of cursor keys, so it still works if the menu changes.
 *
 * A session also closes ITSELF after two minutes with no activity. That is not
 * housekeeping: a browser tab can close, WiFi can drop, a laptop can go flat,
 * and the watchdog is then the only thing left that can walk the radio out of
 * terminal mode. Every screen read and keystroke counts as activity. */

 *
 * Randy N4OPI answered the open question from PuTTY ("Backspace deletes leftward,
 * Del does nothing"), and I read "Backspace" as 0x08. PuTTY's Backspace sends
 * 0x7F by default, so his Backspace WAS 0x7F. Measured on 1_04_004 in
 * Protection -> Max. PA voltage, with up/down as the control: 0x08, left, right
 * and Enter do NOTHING; 0x7F deletes leftward and typing then appends.
 *
 * The key is still NAMED "bksp" and labelled BS, because backspace is what it does
 * to the operator - only the byte changed.
 *
 * ⚠ The model is backspace-and-retype, not arrow-adjust, and the arrows moving
 * between columns in a TABLE is correct behaviour - do not "fix" that. */
