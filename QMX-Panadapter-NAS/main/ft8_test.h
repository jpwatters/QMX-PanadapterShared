// ---- Operating sub-mode (FT8 vs FT4) ------------------------------------
// FT4 and FT8 share the QMX's USB/DiGi data mode and the same ft8_lib
// primitives - they differ only in slot length (15 s vs 7.5 s), symbol rate,
// and the monitor's protocol setting. This runtime flag is set from the FT8
// screen's preset dropdown (the FT4-headed column) and is the hook the slot
// engine reads.
//
// NOTE: the 7.5 s slot rework is NOT done yet. Selecting FT4 currently sets the
// dial frequency + on-screen MODE label and stores this flag, but the
// capture/decode/TX loop in ft8_test.c still runs FT8 timing - so FT4 signals
// will not decode/transmit correctly until that follow-up lands. Wiring the
// flag now is deliberate: it gives the engine work a single, already-plumbed
// point to branch on. See the TODO at the monitor_config in ft8_task().
// FT4 SOFT-DISABLE (2026-07-08): decided to omit FT4 from the app for now -
// too resource-draining, and its tight 7.5 s slot/timing constraints make
// for a very limited experience. This single flag is the entire on/off
// switch: ft8_op_mode_set()/_get() (ft8_test.c) coerce every FT4 request
// (from the UI or a persisted NVS value from before this change) to FT8,
// and ft8_screen_view.c skips building the FT4 preset column entirely, so
// it's not just inert but invisible ("as if it was never there"). No FT4
// code was deleted - flip this back to 0 to fully re-enable, or use it as
// the single point to find every gated call site before removing the FT4
// code path for good, once that's a final decision rather than a pause.
