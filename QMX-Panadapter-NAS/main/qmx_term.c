     *   - Anything changed in there (sidetone, RF gain, a band setting) moves the
     *     noise floor the panadapter is calibrated against.

         * key and deleted 0x7F.
         *
         * PuTTY's Backspace sends 0x7F by default (its "Backspace key" option
         * defaults to Control-?), so his Backspace WAS 0x7F all along, and his
         * "Del does nothing" refers to PuTTY's Delete, which sends ESC[3~.
         *
         * Measured on 1_04_004, in Configuration -> Protection -> Max. PA
         * voltage, with up/down as the control to prove the key path works:
         *
         *   up / down        selection moves, screen updates      (transport OK)
         *   left / right     NOTHING - the radio does not answer
         *   Enter            NOTHING
         *   0x08 (BS)        NOTHING
         *   0x7F (DEL)       "11.5" -> "11." -> "11"   deletes leftward ✓
         *   then '9'         "11" -> "119"              typing appends ✓
         *
         * So the key stays NAMED "bksp" and LABELLED BS - backspace is what it
         * does to the operator - and sends 0x7F, which is what the radio acts on.
         *
         * ⚠ The editing model is backspace-and-retype, NOT arrow-adjust: L/R do
         * nothing on a field like this, and per Randy the arrows moving between
         * columns in a TABLE is correct behaviour. Do not "fix" that.
         *
         * ⚠ And do not conclude anything about numeric fields from the Messages
         * field: my earlier probe there found 0x08 moving the cursor without
         * deleting, which is a text field behaving differently and proved nothing.
