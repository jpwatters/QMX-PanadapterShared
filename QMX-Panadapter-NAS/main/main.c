/* SETTLING MARKS (2026-10-04).
 *
 * WHY: the ledger above stopped at rx_audio_init, about 9 s into the boot,
 * with the DMA pool at 26 KB. Randy N4OPI's v1.16.11 diag then shows it at
 * 13.5 KB by t=17 s and 5.8 KB by t=197 s, and the session that failed was at
 * 2.5 KB - at which point an SD sector read cannot get its 512 B and the web
 * file browser answers "file not found" for a file that is on the card.
 *
 * Twenty kilobytes therefore go AFTER the last ledger line, and nothing in the
 * log says to what. audio.c's 60 s HEAP line gives the curve but no
 * attribution; the per-stage ledger gives attribution but stops too early.
 * These marks close the gap: the per-subsystem marks added in app_main cover
 * the remaining init, and these timed ones cover the part no call site owns -
 * WiFi association, the first web client, the FT8 engine reaching steady
 * state. The next field diag should name the consumer instead of posing the
 * question.
 *
 * One-shot chain rather than a periodic timer: three lines total, then it is
 * gone. It costs nothing and cannot itself become the drain. */

 * Hooks are global and must be installed before ANY cJSON use. heap_caps_free
