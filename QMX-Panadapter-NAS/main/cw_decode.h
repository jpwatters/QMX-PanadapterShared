// Decoded CW text from the QMX's OWN decoder, delivered over CAT.
//
// The radio already decodes CW in its microcontroller and will hand the text to
// a CAT host on request, so this costs the Tab5 no DSP at all - one more slot in
// a poll rotation that is already running. That matters here specifically:
// core 0 is the wall on this board (taskLVGL alone is 73.9% of it), and every
// previous attempt at doing audio work for CW ourselves ran into it. Suggested
// by Uwe DL8UG, who had already built it for himself.
//
// ⭐ `TB` is in the 1_03 CAT manual as well as 1_04, so this needs NO
// cat_qmx_fw_at_least() gate - unlike AM and SWR Tune. It works on the firmware
// people are already running.
//
// ⛔ THE RADIO'S BUFFER IS 40 CHARACTERS AND IT IS NOT CIRCULAR. The CAT manual
// is explicit: "When it fills up, it simply discards any new incoming
// characters." So TB; has to be polled at a steady cadence rather than read on
// demand - at 20 WPM the radio fills it in roughly 24 seconds, and text lost
// there is lost silently, with nothing in the response to say it happened.
//
// We do NOT enable the decoder over CAT. Its "Enable Rx"/"Enable Tx" parameters
// default to YES in the radio's own Decoder menu, so it is normally already on,
// and writing an MM path we have not verified against a radio is exactly the
// guessing CLAUDE.md keeps warning about.

// ---- noise squelch ---------------------------------------------------------
//
// With no signal the radio's decoder chews on noise and emits a stream of E and
// T - "TTTTTTTTETTTTTTT" - because those are the two SHORTEST Morse symbols (a
// single dit and a single dah), so a random threshold crossing is far more
// likely to land on one of them than on anything longer. It is worst just after
// switching to CW, while the decoder's own amplitude tracking is still settling.
//
// So: hold a run of E/T back rather than printing it, and decide once something
// else arrives. A SHORT run was real text and is released intact; a long one was
// noise and is dropped. Spaces neither start nor break a run - noise produces
// plenty of them - but any other character ends it.
//
// This cannot make a wrong decision permanently: at most CW_SQUELCH_RUN
// characters are ever held, and a genuine "EEEE" (unusual in real CW) costs
// nothing but those characters.

//
// ⭐ It lives HERE rather than in the UI because BOTH screens draw it - the
// Tab5's panadapter and the browser's. Two copies of "where does the next
// character go" would drift the moment one of them changed, and the operator
// asked for them to be identical.
//
// 72 columns is what the Tab5 has left after the green "CW ~08wpm:" header at
// 15 px per character across 1280 px. The browser uses the same number so the
// two wrap in the same places.
//
// 71 until the header lost its space before "wpm" (operator, 2026-09-06). This
// is NOT a free choice: ui.c static-asserts that the header width and this add
// up to the 84 columns the display has, so narrowing the header WIDENS the
// line by the same column. That assert is what caught it.

 * So the grid is one buffer of CW_LINE_ROWS * CW_LINE_COLS and the write
