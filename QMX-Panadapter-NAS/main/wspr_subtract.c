/* ⛔ NO cos()/sin() PER SAMPLE. This function ran two loops of 8192 samples per
 * symbol, each calling cos() and sin() on a double - 5.3 MILLION software
 * double trig calls per subtracted signal. On the ESP32-P4, whose FPU is
 * single-precision only, that measured at 67 SECONDS per signal on hardware:
 * a 120 s WSPR cycle went from 58 s to 154 s and started overrunning its own
 * decode budget. On a host it is invisible - hardware double, fast libm - so
 * it survived every host test of the two-pass path.
 *
 * Instead the oscillator advances by one complex multiply per sample in float
 * and is re-seeded from the exact phase every OSC_RESEED samples. Error can
 * then accumulate over at most 512 float steps and is WIPED rather than
 * rescaled, so this is not a precision trade - the fit and the residual are as
 * good as before, at about a thousandth of the trig cost. */
