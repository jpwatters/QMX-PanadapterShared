 * not: the step choice, the strictly-inside edge rule and the descending order
 * all have off-by-one traps, and the whole point of the change is that a value

 *
 * The step is the smallest candidate that still fits within max_n lines, so a
 * narrow range gets finer lines rather than fewer. Returns 0 for a degenerate
 * range (hi <= lo) - callers must treat 0 as "draw no scale", never as an error
 * to paper over with a default.
