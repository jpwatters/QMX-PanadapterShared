// Diagnostic logger: an always-on in-RAM ring buffer that captures all
// ESP_LOG output (and per-line CAT TX/RX traffic) so that whenever something
// goes wrong, the log is already there to hand back — no need to have flipped
// a switch beforehand.
//
// Three extraction paths:
//   - USB serial: everything still streams to the console as normal, so the
//     existing tools/capture_serial_log.ps1 keeps working (works with no WiFi).
//   - WiFi: the web UI exposes GET /api/log which downloads the ring buffer
//     as qmx-log.txt.
//   - microSD: storage/sd_archive mirrors the ring to /sdcard as a rotating
//     file (the persistence path — the PSRAM ring is wiped on reboot, the SD
//     copy survives the reboot that follows a crash). It reads the ring
//     incrementally via diag_log_total() / diag_log_read_from().
//
// The capture hook is installed once at boot (diag_log_init) and capture is
// on from that point — no enable flag, no opt-in.

/* ⛔ WHY THE RESET REASON IS NOW READABLE OUTSIDE THIS FILE.
 *
 * Samuel W7STF spent days on "the Tab5 reboots on its own" while listening to
 * SSB, suspected his own unit, and posted "it's bothersome others are not
 * reporting this." His three diagnostic logs contain TEN
 * `reset_reason=brownout` lines: his supply rail is collapsing, not our
 * firmware crashing. Every one of those reboots was already correctly
 * identified by reset_reason_str() - and then written only to a log file
 * nobody reads until they think to send it.
 *
 * A brownout is the one reset reason the OPERATOR can act on, and the only
 * one that is not our bug. It must reach a screen.
 *
 * Returns the same short string the session header prints ("brownout",
 * "panic/exception", "power-on", ...). Never NULL. */
