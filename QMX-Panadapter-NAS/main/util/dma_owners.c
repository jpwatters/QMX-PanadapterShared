// dma_owners.c - who actually owns MALLOC_CAP_DMA?
//
// === TEMP INSTRUMENT (#283). DELETE WITH THE DIAGNOSIS - see the checklist in
// === TODO #283. This file is deliberately self-contained so removing it is one
// === `rm` plus three call-site lines.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//   The DMA-capable pool is the scarce resource on this board, and CLAUDE.md
//   records it at 40-41 KB with WiFi fully up after the TODO #65 .bss fix
//   (2026-08-05). On 2026-08-28 it measures ~8 KB with Bluetooth off and ~4.7 KB
//   with it on - and at 4.7 KB FatFs cannot get a sector buffer, so fopen()
//   returns EIO, the SD archive's slow mirror fails three times and unmounts a
//   perfectly good card (the operator watched the dot vanish).
//
//   Three candidates were eliminated by measurement rather than argument: .bss
//   creep (154,290 B in libmain, matching the 153,906 already recorded, so no
//   drift), the NimBLE tuning going missing (present in sdkconfig AND
//   sdkconfig.defaults), and Bluetooth itself (worth ~3.4 KB - the straw, not
//   the load). Eliminating one subsystem per reboot from there is guesswork
//   with a QMX power cycle attached to each guess.
//
//   heap_caps_get_per_task_info() partitions per-task allocation totals BY
//   CAPABILITY, so it answers the question directly: which task is holding the
//   DMA-capable bytes. That is a name, not another elimination.
//
// ⛔ ON DEMAND ONLY - NEVER ON A PERIODIC PATH.
//   This walks the heap with interrupts off, which is the documented cause of
//   the full-screen cyan flash on this panel (see the note in audio.c, and #281
//   where exactly this call sat on the FT8 per-slot path at 7.5 s intervals).
//   One invocation may cost a one-frame blink; CLAUDE.md permits that for
//   on-demand diagnostics and for nothing else.
//
// ⚠ THE INSTRUMENT PERTURBS WHAT IT MEASURES. CONFIG_HEAP_TASK_TRACKING stores
//   an owning-task handle in every block header, so absolute free figures on
//   this build are LOWER than on a shipping build. The ATTRIBUTION is what this
//   is for - who holds the bytes, in what proportion - not the totals. Do not
//   quote a dma-free number measured on a tracking build as if it were normal.

/* =========================================================================
 * WHO IS EATING CORE 0?  (#284, 2026-08-28)
 *
 * === TEMP INSTRUMENT. Delete with dma_owners.c - same checklist. ===
 *
 * WHY: the panadapter has sat at 0-7% core-0 idle for months and CLAUDE.md's
 * v1.8.3 note calls it "unexplained". The software 90-degree rotation was the
 * obvious suspect and was MEASURED OUT on this date: neutering rotate90_rgb565
 * so the screen showed garbage while everything else stayed byte-identical
 * moved idle0 from 6.9-7.6% to only 14.3-15.4%. So the rotation is worth ~7
 * points and something ELSE holds ~85% of the core.
 *
 * Guessing which task that is costs a QMX power cycle per guess, and today
 * already spent three of those on theories that hardware refused (a cache
 * working set, a smaller flush strip, moving LVGL to core 1). So: measure.
 * CONFIG_FREERTOS_GENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS is already on, so every task's
 * ulRunTimeCounter is available; two snapshots a second apart give each task's
 * share directly, which is a name rather than another theory.
 *
 * ⛔ ON DEMAND ONLY. uxTaskGetSystemState() byte-walks every task's stack
 * inside a kernel critical section - the documented cyan-flash cause - and this
 * calls it TWICE. One invocation may cost a frame blink; that is the price
 * CLAUDE.md permits for an on-demand diagnostic and for nothing else.
 *
 * ⚠ The counter is summed over BOTH cores, so the percentages total ~200%, not
 * 100%. Read a task's share against the core its `core` column names; an
 * unpinned task (core -1) may have run on either.

// WHY THIS EXISTS: MALLOC_CAP_DMA measured 54,355 B at 7.0 s and 10,499 B at
// 15.6 s on the rx-audio bench - 44 KB gone in 8.6 s - then drifted to about
// 2,231 B, at which point the SD card writes started failing with EIO and a
// 736-byte largest block. The consumer of those 44 KB is not identified, and
// the /api/cmd route to this report is useless for finding it: WiFi on this
// track wedges within minutes, and the window in question closes at 15.6 s,
// barely after the link has an IP.
//
// So the report triggers ITSELF at fixed uptimes and goes to the serial log,
// which needs no network and survives the wedge. Same reasoning that moved
// the rx_audio capture to a serial dump.
//
// ⛔ STILL NOT PERIODIC. Three one-shot reports, then the task deletes
// itself. dma_owners_report() walks the heap with interrupts off, which is
// the documented cause of this panel's cyan flash (#281) - a handful of
// one-off blinks during boot diagnostics is the same exemption the on-demand
// route already takes, a repeating timer is not.
//
// ⚠ Needs CONFIG_HEAP_TASK_TRACKING, which is DELIBERATELY off in
// sdkconfig.defaults for shipping builds - so a fullclean reverts it and this
// trace goes quiet by itself. Read the ATTRIBUTION, not the totals: block
// headers are larger on a tracking build, so absolute free figures run low.
