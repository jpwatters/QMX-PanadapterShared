/* heap_watch.c - find out WHAT eats internal RAM, without a soak.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-26)
 * ----------------------------
 * A 20.5 h idle capture settled the leak question: internal free trends
 * +0.072 KB/h - flat. There is no leak. What the same capture DID show is 84
 * separate events where `heap_caps_get_free_size(MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL)` read
 * zero, against a stable ~22 KB baseline, and the dip rate does not grow with
 * uptime (3.1% of samples in hour 0, 3.6% in hour 20, 0.0% in hours 11-14).
 *
 * That is a recurring transient, not a leak, and it is where
 * esp_dma_capable_malloc() refuses - the measured root cause of SD "goes
 * yellow", and of BLE silently failing to start.
 *
 * ⛔ THE 10 s HEAP LINE IN audio.c CANNOT SEE IT. Every dip but one was a
 * single 10 s sample, so the event is somewhere under 10 s and its real
 * duration is unknown. Correlating the dips against every other log tag found
 * nothing: 5 `cat` lines, 4 `rx_audio` resample warnings and 3 SDIO drains
 * against 89 dip samples. The consumer does not log. So instrument it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES
 * --------------
 * 1. Samples internal free every HEAP_WATCH_PERIOD_MS with the O(1) counter
 *    query only, and reports a dip as ONE line when it ENDS: how deep, how
 *    long, how many samples. Duration is the thing worth knowing first - it
 *    decides whether a dump can ever catch the hog (long dip) or whether only
 *    heap tracing will (short dip).
 *
 * 2. Names the victim of any allocation that actually FAILS, via
 *    heap_caps_register_failed_alloc_callback(). The callback runs in the
 *    failing task's own context, so the task name is the caller.
 *
 * ⛔ THE CALLBACK DOES NOT LOG. It may be entered from an ISR or with the heap
 * lock held, and ESP_LOGx from there can deadlock or corrupt the line. It
 * records into plain statics and the sampler task prints on change - the same
 * discipline sock_probe uses.
 *
 * ⛔ heap_caps_get_largest_free_block() WALKS THE HEAP WITH INTERRUPTS OFF and
 * must never go on a periodic path - that is what caused the FT4 cyan flash
 * (see audio.c's own note). It is called here ONCE per dip entry, which is 84
 * times in 20 hours, not 50 times a second.
