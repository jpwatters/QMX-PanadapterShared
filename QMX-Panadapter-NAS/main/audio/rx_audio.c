// every 120 ms even when fully idle, preempting fft_task - the audio ring's
// sole consumer for both the panadapter spectrum and every FT8/FT4 capture -
// roughly 125 times per 15 s FT8 slot, for the entire session. That let ring
// backlog grow slot over slot, so later captures decoded time-shifted audio:
// still found sync (jitter-tolerant) but failed LDPC decode (needs exact
// symbol alignment). Root-caused 2026-06-25/26 (see CLAUDE.md, "CW audio
// (shelved)"). This task is pinned BELOW fft_task instead, so FreeRTOS's
// preemptive scheduler cannot hand it the CPU while fft_task is ready - not
// "usually doesn't," structurally cannot. See rx_audio.h for the rest of the
// design (blocked-not-polling while disabled, mode-aware filtering).
// Stack for the short-lived core-1 task that opens the I2S channel + codec
// (see rx_audio_preopen). 4096 overflowed on the first boot it was tried;
// 16 KB is deliberately far more than the measured need, which the task logs
// as a high water mark - this runs once at boot and is freed immediately.

// ---- Filter design tunables -----------------------------------------------
// History: FIR_LEN went 63 -> 1023 (too slow, no audio at all) -> 255 (audio
// back, but transition band ~622 Hz - still leaking content 200-300 Hz off
// the dial into a nominal 150 Hz CW filter, confirmed on the air 2026-09-04).
//
// Then a SECOND bug, found the same day once audio was flowing again and
// still measured wider than the set 150 Hz: the "decimate to get narrower
// selectivity for the same tap count" idea was right, but it was implemented
// as ONE dsps_fird_f32 call whose coefficients were designed against the
// DECIMATED rate (half_bw_hz / (fs/D)). dsps_fird_f32 is a single-stage
// polyphase decimator - it filters the FULL-RATE input directly (just
// computing only every Dth output), so per its own header and this
// codebase's own zoom-FFT precedent (dsp.c's zoom_design_lpf, called with
// cutoff_norm = 0.45/D - a fraction of the FULL rate, not the decimated one)
// its coefficients must be normalised against the INPUT rate. Designing them
// against fs/D instead made the numeric cutoff fraction D x too large, so
// the realised cutoff was D x wider than intended (150 Hz requested -> ~1200
// Hz actual at D=8) - exactly "much wider than the set 150Hz", on the air.
//
// A single fused decimating stage genuinely CANNOT give ~75 Hz half-bandwidth
// selectivity for an affordable tap count at the full 48 kHz rate - that's
// the same wall FIR_LEN=1023 hit (transition ~155 Hz there, and already too
// slow). The actual win from decimating only appears with TWO stages:
//   Stage 1 (dsps_fird_f32, FIR_DECIM_LEN taps, fixed, mode-independent):
//     a coarse anti-alias/decimate filter, cutoff_norm = 0.45/RX_DECIM_D
//     against the FULL rate - the same convention and tap count as the
//     zoom-FFT's own ZOOMFIR (measured ~1.0 ms/window there for 63 taps).
//   Stage 2 (dsps_fir_f32, NON-decimating, FIR_LEN taps, rebuilt per mode):
//     runs on the now-decimated fs/RX_DECIM_D stream, so a cutoff genuinely
//     computed against THAT rate (half_bw_hz/(fs/D)) is correct here, and
//     the same FIR_LEN=255 taps gives transition ~78 Hz (3.3*6000/255) at a
//     fraction of the cost 255 taps would have at the full rate, because it
//     only ever sees n_out = pairs/RX_DECIM_D samples per frame instead of
//     pairs.
// D=8 -> 6 kHz internal rate, Nyquist 3 kHz, comfortably above SSB's widest
// half-bandwidth (~1500 Hz) so one D covers both modes.
//
// The output of stage 2 is only DSP_FFT_SIZE/RX_DECIM_D samples/frame; NCO2
// and the AGC/output stage now run at that rate too, and the result is
// upsampled back to 48 kHz by simple sample-and-hold (repeat each sample
// RX_DECIM_D times) before the codec write - crude, but the audio content
// here (a CW/SSB tone under ~3 kHz) is far below where a zero-order hold's
// imaging artifacts would matter for this purpose. Revisit with linear

/* ⭐ RESCALED FOR THE DECIMATED LOOP - and this time the symptom that judges it
 * is SSB intelligibility, not CW clicking.
 *
 * These are per-sample coefficients and the AGC runs on the fs/RX_DECIM_D
 * stream (6 kHz), not 48 kHz. tau ~= 1/(alpha*fs), so at 6 kHz the bare figures
 * gave 1/(0.007*6000) = 24 ms attack and 1/(0.00014*6000) = 1.2 s release -
 * eight times slower than the 3 ms / 150 ms they were written for, exactly the
 * RX_DECIM_D factor.
 *
 * ⛔ WHY THIS WAS REVERTED ONCE AND IS BACK. The rescale was tried before and
 * dropped because it "made no confirmed difference to the reported on-air
 * artifact" - but that artifact was CW CLICKING, and CW is the one case these
 * constants cannot hurt: a steady tone settles the AGC once and never tests its
 * rate. The change was judged against a symptom it could not have fixed.
 *
 * Gyula HA3HZ, 2026-09-21, is the symptom it CAN fix: "LSB/USB signals appear
 * very distorted ... unintelligible", while CW the same afternoon was clear.
 * Speech is what a 24 ms attack and a 1.2 s release destroy - every syllable
 * onset overshoots into out_clamp before the gain moves, then the gain stays
 * ducked through the syllables that follow.
 *
 * Multiplying by RX_DECIM_D restores the intended 3 ms / 150 ms and, because it
 * is written as the scaling rather than a new literal, it follows RX_DECIM_D if
 * the decimation ever changes again - which is how it drifted in the first
 * place.
 *
 * ⚠ NOT VERIFIED ON AIR. Both are live-tunable over /api/cmd "rxaudio", so if
 * this does bring back a CW artifact it can be put back without a reflash. */

/* ---- CHIRP CHARACTERISATION (2026-09-06) --------------------------------
 *
 * The operator hears a chirp every 4-5 s ON A SILENT BAND WITH NO SIGNAL, so

 * faded frame of silence, i.e. a gap. read to=1656 over 3360 s is one gap
 * every ~2 s, the same order as what he hears.
 *
 * What we cannot yet say is WHY the ring runs dry on a cadence, and the two
 * candidates need different fixes:
 *
 *   RATE MISMATCH  - the QMX's audio clock is not bit-exact 48 kHz (CLAUDE.md
 *                    records the FT8 capture needing a UTC boundary for this
 *                    very reason). If we consume faster than it produces, the
 *                    ring drains steadily and underruns at a NEAR-CONSTANT
 *                    interval. More buffering only makes it rarer, never
 *                    fixes it; the fix is rate adaptation.
 *   CONTENTION     - something periodic starves the producer. Then the
 *                    intervals are IRREGULAR and cluster around that event.
 *
 * The interval between gaps discriminates them, so that is what this records:
 * the spread of the last intervals, and the ring level at the moment of the
 * gap. A tight spread means rate; a wide one means contention. */
/* ---- RECORDER (2026-09-06) ----------------------------------------------
 *
 * ⭐ OBSERVE THE PHENOMENON BEFORE EXPLAINING IT. Counting events says WHEN
 * something happened and never WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE - and "chirp", "stutter"
 * and "click" are different artefacts with different causes. A frequency sweep,
 * a step discontinuity, a burst of noise and a hole in the audio all sound
 * wrong and look nothing like each other.
 *
 * So this keeps the EXACT samples handed to the codec, in PSRAM (which has
 * ~15 MB spare), and serves them as a WAV. Mono: the two channels are written
 * identical a few lines below, so a second copy would only double the size.
 *
 * Alongside it, the sample index of every gap - so an artefact seen in the
 * waveform can be matched against the event that produced it, or shown NOT to
 * coincide with one, which would be just as informative.

// ⛔ WHY A LOW-PASS, NOT A BAND-PASS CENTERED ON THE OFFSET (2026-09-04):
// the original cw_audio.c design mixed the wanted signal down to +offset Hz,
// took the REAL PART of that complex mix (discarding the imaginary part), and
// only THEN band-pass filtered - on the theory that "the -offset mirror is
// rejected by the narrow band-pass". It is not, and cannot be: a real-valued
// signal is inherently symmetric around 0 Hz (that is what "real" means
// spectrally), so by the time the real part was extracted, the true +offset
// content and whatever ELSE was sitting at -offset (an unrelated part of the
// band - which is why the field report described it as sounding "like digi"
// near an FT8 sub-band) were already folded on top of each other. No filter
// applied afterward, however narrow, can un-fold them - the phase information
// needed to tell them apart was already discarded. Reported on the air
// 2026-09-04: rough/broadband, not a clean tone, pitch barely moved while
// tuning - exactly what a folded image sounds like.
//
// The fix keeps BOTH real and imaginary parts through the whole chain: shift
// the wanted signal all the way down to complex 0 (NCO1, below), low-pass
// filter that - a real-coefficient low-pass applied identically to both I and
// Q of a complex signal is unambiguous exactly AT 0, because that is where a
// low-pass's symmetric passband is actually centered on the thing we want -
// then shift the filtered result back UP to the audible pitch (NCO2) and only
// THEN take the real part for playback. This is the standard SSB/CW "phasing
// method" replayed as shift-filter-shift-back instead of a Hilbert pair,
// which needs only two real low-pass filters instead of a 90-degree
// all-pass network. CW and SSB share this unchanged - SSB had the identical

             *   no correction at all (v1.16.1)  SNDR 32.9 dB   46.9 Hz  -160 dBc
             *   per-frame single step           SNDR 29.0 dB   46.9 Hz   -37 dBc
             *   continuous fractional resample  SNDR 33.0 dB   46.9 Hz   -74 dBc
             *
             * i.e. it restores the UNCORRECTED purity exactly while still
             * absorbing the clock difference. (The 33 dB floor is this linear
             * upsampler itself and is present in every version - not a

            /* ⛔⛔ THE ACTUAL RUNAWAY BUG (found 2026-09-23, on re-reading the
             * whole block rather than re-simulating the rate math again - the
             * operator was right that simulation was not finding this).
             *
             * The buffer only had "+1" pair of headroom, sized for the OLD
             * spliced corrector which added at most one sample. THIS
             * resampler can need MANY more: stretching a full DSP_FFT_SIZE
             * (1024) input frame by even the measured 0.24% needs ~2.5 EXTRA
             * output samples, and dsp_rxaudio_read asks for a full frame
             * essentially every call - so the `outn < DSP_FFT_SIZE` cap was
             * being hit on ordinary frames, not just a pathological one, and
             * NOTHING ABOUT THAT DEPENDS ON THERE BEING A SIGNAL - which is
             * why the operator heard it grow on a completely silent band.
             *
             * And the old code decremented s_up_phase UNCONDITIONALLY after
             * the while loop:
             *
             *     while (s_up_phase < 1.0f && outn < CAP) { ... }
             *     s_up_phase -= 1.0f;
             *
             * When the loop exits because the CAP stopped it (phase still
             * <1.0, not because phase reached 1.0), subtracting 1.0 anyway
             * drives s_up_phase NEGATIVE. Next input sample, the while
             * condition (phase < 1.0) is now true for many more iterations
             * than it should be, each one computing `frac = s_up_phase` -
             * strongly negative - which the linear interpolation
             * (last + delta*frac) EXTRAPOLATES far outside the two real
             * samples instead of interpolating between them. If the cap is
             * hit again before phase claws back to normal (likely, since the
             * buffer is still the same size), phase goes more negative still.
             * That is a compounding, self-worsening runaway with no signal
             * amplitude anywhere in its cause - exactly "starts faint, then
             * increases, and increases" on a silent band, and exactly why the
             * two earlier "fixes" to the RATE MATH (attempts #3 and #4 in the
             * commit history) could never have touched it: this bug is in
             * the BUFFER ACCOUNTING around the resampler, not in the rate
             * controller feeding it.
             *
             * Fixed two ways, either of which alone would have stopped the
             * compounding, but both belong here:
             *   1. RX_OUT_HEADROOM (64 pairs) - sized for the resample
             *      clamp's worst case (~21 samples at +/-2%), not the ~2.5
             *      actually needed today, so ordinary operation never
             *      touches the cap at all.
             *   2. The phase decrement is now conditional on the loop having
             *      exited NORMALLY (phase actually reached >=1.0). If the cap
             *      stops it instead, phase is left exactly as it was and the
             *      remaining decimated samples for this call are silently
             *      skipped (a few microseconds of audio, not a corruption) -
             *      the next call resumes cleanly from a valid phase.
             *
             * This is also why "measure, don't simulate the part you already
             * modelled" only gets you so far: the rate-drift simulations were
             * accurate FOR THE RATE MATH. They could not have found a buffer
             * size bug because the model never allocated a buffer. */

     *
     * Measured on bench dev, 2026-09-25, with headphones plugged in the whole
     * time and nothing touching the jack:
     *     5463.8 s  headphones out - internal speaker on
     *     5464.8 s  headphones IN  - internal speaker OFF
     * One poll read the wrong value and the next corrected it. The detect is a
     * single I2C read of the PI4IO expander's input register on a bus shared
     * with the touch controller and the battery monitor, and it is not
     * filtered anywhere - so that glitch went straight to the amplifier.
     *
     * In that direction it is a one-second burst from the speaker while
     * someone is on headphones. In the other direction - a spurious "IN" on an
     * EMPTY jack - it mutes the speaker of someone who is not wearing
     * headphones at all. Steve N9SZ reported exactly "no audio from the Tab5"
     * on v1.16.4, the release that started calling this every second.
     *
     * ⚠ THIS IS NOT A PROVEN EXPLANATION OF HIS FAULT. A single glitch
     * self-corrects on the next poll, so it gives a ~1 s dropout, not
     * permanent silence; his would need a reading that is persistently wrong.
     * This fix removes a real defect that the bench measured. It does not
     * close his report, and the fix must not be announced as though it does.
     *
     * Deliberately NOT a running average or a hysteresis timer: the operator
     * moves a jack at human speed and the only thing worth rejecting is a
     * sample that disagrees with its neighbours. */
