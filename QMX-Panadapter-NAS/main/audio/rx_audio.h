// RX audio out: demodulate the tuned signal from the QMX I/Q stream and play
// it on the Tab5's built-in speaker / headphone jack, so an operator can
// listen without external audio gear - "hear what the panadapter is showing."
//
// Supersedes the CW-only cw_audio.c prototype (see memory
// project_rx_audio_track.md, Track A). Two things changed on top of that
// prototype's proven pieces (the I2S preopen-before-USB-host ordering, the
// internal-RAM forward ring in dsp.c):
//
//   1. Mode-aware filtering (CW/CW-R narrow-band around the CW offset,
//      USB/LSB a voice-width passband) instead of CW only.
//   2. The consumer task is now STRUCTURALLY unable to preempt fft_task: it
//      runs at a priority BELOW fft_task's (RX_AUDIO_TASK_PRIORITY <
//      DSP_FFT_TASK_PRIORITY in dsp.h), so FreeRTOS's preemptive scheduler
//      cannot hand it the CPU while fft_task is ready - regardless of wake
//      cadence. On top of that, the task is fully BLOCKED (no wakeups at
//      all) whenever RX audio is disabled, which is the default. The
//      original cw_audio_task's bug was priority 6 (ABOVE fft_task's 4)
//      waking every 120 ms even when idle - see cw_audio.c's git history
//      and CLAUDE.md's "CW audio (shelved)" section for the post-mortem.
//
// Gated to CW/CW-R/USB/LSB; any other mode (DiGi, AM, TUNE, unknown) is
// treated as unsupported and the path stays idle.

// One-time bring-up: open the ES8388 codec (48 kHz, 16-bit stereo) via the

// Safe to call once from app_main after settings_init().

 * The ES8388/I2S codec is opened once at boot, and only when the saved enable
 * flag was already set - it has to claim its DMA RAM before the USB host takes
 * that pool, so it cannot be opened later in the session. Turning RX audio on
 * afterwards therefore sets the flag, logs "restart required", and produces no
 * sound at all until the next boot.
 *
 * Samuel W7STF, 2026-10-02: booted with audio off, used the radio for 15
 * minutes, turned audio on and heard nothing - "I had to reboot the Tab5 and
 * QMX/+ for audio to work. This is not the way it's supposed to be switched
 * on/off, is it?" The behaviour was right and the UI was silent about it,
 * which is the part that was wrong. Ask this after enabling and say so. */
