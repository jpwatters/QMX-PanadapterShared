/* The FT8/FT4 slot loop's two transmit gates, as a pure decision.
 *
 * Portable on purpose (no ESP deps) so test/ft8_slot_gate_harness.c can link the
 * REAL functions. This exists because the decision was inline in ft8_test.c's
 * slot loop, could only be exercised with a live streaming radio, and shipped
 * broken twice:
 *
 *  - v1.10.2: the HOLD gate was opened to FT4 while the LATE-FIRE gate 180 lines
 *    below stayed FT8-only. An FT4 burst was held at the boundary and nothing
 *    was permitted to fire it, so FT4 stopped transmitting altogether. Reported
 *    by Gyula HA3HZ within hours.
 *  - The bench could not catch it: with the radio wedged there is no audio, so
 *    no decode job is ever queued, so the hold condition can never arise and the
 *    identical test passes on the broken build (#299).
 *
 * The invariant that makes that class impossible is stated here and enforced by
 * the harness: a protocol that may be HELD must also be allowed to LATE-FIRE.
 * Holding a burst that nothing may fire is a dead transmitter.
 *
 * The second invariant is arithmetic: firing at the latest permitted moment must
 * not overrun the slot. The old shared FT8_REPLY_TX_WINDOW_MS of 2800 ms broke
 * it for BOTH protocols (FT8 has 2360 ms of room, FT4 2460 ms); it rarely bit
 * only because decodes usually land about a second in.

 * every FT8_GATE_POLL_MS - so the "fire whatever is armed rather than skip the
