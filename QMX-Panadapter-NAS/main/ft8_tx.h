// v0.12.0: Manual FT8 TX core (Reply + Call CQ).
//
// Message-agnostic TX engine driven entirely over CAT via the QMX's TA;
// ("Transmit Audio") command, which sets the transmitted audio tone
// frequency directly in decimal Hz - the radio does its own DDS synthesis
// (Si5351/MS5351M) and Blackmann-Harris envelope shaping. We never
// synthesize PCM audio or touch the USB UAC playback path; the whole job
// reduces to encoding the message to 79 tone indices (ft8_lib already does
// this for RX) and walking through them with one TA<freq>; CAT command
// every 160 ms, bracketed by TX; / TA0; / RX;. See
// docs/qmx-reference/SOURCES.md for the distilled CAT sequence and the
// reasoning for why this is simpler (and more precise) than the
// conventional WSJT-X PC-streams-audio workflow.
//
// Runs entirely inside the existing ft8_task slot loop (ft8_test.c) - no
// new FreeRTOS task, no new stack/PSRAM allocation. Each 15 s slot is
// either RX (decode, exactly as before) or, if a matching TX request is
// armed, a ~12.7 s CAT burst (this module). TX and RX structurally cannot
// overlap: a slot is one or the other, which is also *correct* - while
// keyed up, the QMX's USB audio captures its own TX output, not the air.
