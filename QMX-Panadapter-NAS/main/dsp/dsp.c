/* ⭐ TIME-BASE REPAIR: FILL AUDIO THAT NEVER ARRIVED (2026-09-11).
 *
 * The pre-ring's position is a SAMPLE COUNT, so it only advances when audio
 * arrives. Audio lost upstream - at the USB wire, which isochronous transfer
 * never retries and nothing counts (#51, #376) - therefore does not leave a hole;
 * it silently shortens the time base. Everything after the loss arrives early
 * relative to the UTC-anchored window. For FT8 that is an offset. For WSPR it is
 * a RATE error, and it is fatal: the 17:08 cycle on 2026-09-11 lost 1.7 % of
 * its audio (3.7 % during a 51 s stretch), about 3 symbols of slip, and all 20
 * candidates - several strong enough to see plainly on the carpet - failed with
 * the Fano search at its ceiling. The very next cycle, with 0.1 % loss,
 * decoded two stations on the same build.
 *
 * The repair is to hold the ring to the WALL CLOCK: when fewer samples have
 * arrived than time has passed, the difference is filled with silence at about
 * the point it went missing. A few symbols then carry a gap - which the code's
 * FEC is built to ride through - instead of every later symbol sitting in the
 * wrong place, which it is not.
 *
 * ⛔ A LATE SAMPLE IS NOT A LOST ONE, and that is the whole design. Upstream of
 * this ring the audio is buffered - 1.0 s in the UAC driver's ring
 * (INTERNAL_RX_BUF_BYTES) plus 0.34 s in audio.c's sample ring - so a busy
 * moment shows here as a temporary shortfall that the backlog then repays.
 * Filling that would be worse than nothing: the real samples arrive afterwards
 * and everything after them lands LATE by the amount filled. So a shortfall is
 * only filled once it has persisted for a whole GAPFILL_BUCKET_US - the MINIMUM
 * over the bucket must still be short. No backlog can hold that long: at 1.34 s
 * of total buffering, a consumer stalled for longer overflows and loses the
 * audio for real, at which point filling it is correct.
 *
 * The line is re-anchored whenever arrivals run AHEAD of it (the QMX's clock a
 * hair fast, or an anchor taken while a backlog was draining), so it rides the
 * earliest-arrival edge and needs no clock estimate. A QMX clock slightly SLOW
 * gets a 30 ms fill every few minutes, which is also correct: WSPR and FT8 both
 * want samples on UTC.
 *
 * Counted, never silent (#189): s_gapfill_total is reported on every arm line,
 * so a repaired cycle still says it lost audio. dsp_gapfill_set_enabled() turns
 * the repair off for an A/B (dev action `gapfill`). */

// Allocate the ring now, before WiFi/BLE/spots fragment RAM for the rest of
// the session. Found 2026-09-04: creating it lazily on first CW/SSB
// activation (the old behaviour of dsp_rxaudio_forward_enable() below) meant
// the 24 KB contiguous request competed with a heap that only gets MORE
// fragmented as the session runs, so a unit that had been up for a while
// could never get it. Call this as early as possible (rx_audio_preopen(),
// same place I2S grabs its DMA RAM before the USB host starts). Idempotent.
//
// ⭐ PSRAM, NOT MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL (2026-09-30). This was internal RAM, and
// the comment here used to end "24 KB sitting idle is cheap next to losing RX
// audio for a whole session". That trade was measured against the wrong thing.
// On ESP32-P4 internal RAM IS the MALLOC_CAP_DMA pool, so this 24 KB was being
// taken straight out of the pool the SD card needs - and the SD path needs a
// SMALL DMA allocation on EVERY 512 B block transfer, forever, not once.
//
// Gyula HA3HZ, qmx-diag-20260930-0914, RX audio on (CW to the Tab5 speaker):
//
//     rx_audio_preopen (I2S)   dma= 92767 (lblk 40960)   <- 21.6 KB I2S
//     dsp: rxaudio_ring created early (24576 bytes)      <- + this 24 KB
//     ...
//     rx_audio_init            dma=  8179 (lblk  6400)   <- end of boot
//
// 8179 B of DMA-capable RAM left, 6400 B largest block. His card then mounted,
// wrote README.txt + qso.adi (163655 B) + qmx-config.txt fine, and died on the
// next transfer: spi_master.c's setup_priv_desc() could not get its per-block
// bounce buffer, and it fails AFTER poll_data_token() has succeeded, i.e. with
// the card already streaming. sdspi_host_start_command() then drops CS with
// the card mid-block, so every later command reads a garbage R1 (0x108
// ESP_ERR_INVALID_RESPONSE, CMD13 status 0xff3f = MISO stuck idle-high) and
// sd_archive counts five of those and unmounts. Remount cannot recover it:
// mount retry 1/12 failed on a 516 B DMA alloc, retry 2/12 on a 64 B one.
// My bench never showed any of it - it ends boot at dma=40695 lblk=31744.
//
// So: one transient shortage kills the card for the whole session, and this
// ring is the single biggest thing standing between the SD path and enough
// headroom to survive. The ring itself has no reason to be DMA-capable - it is
// a plain byte buffer of audio samples, written by audio_task (process_rx) and
// read by rx_audio_task, both ordinary tasks, so PSRAM is safe here. It never
// goes near an ISR. At 48 kHz stereo it carries 192 KB/s against PSRAM that
// sustains far more, with ~14 MB free.
//
// This also retires the fragility the 2026-09-04 note was written about: a
// 24 KB contiguous request is hard in a fragmented internal heap and trivial
// in PSRAM, so the "unit that had been up for a while could never get it"
// failure cannot happen either way round.
//
// ⚠ NOT yet confirmed to fix Gyula's card - his unit is the only place the
// fault has ever been seen, and my bench has 5x his DMA headroom so it cannot
// reproduce it. What IS measured here is the 24 KB coming back.
