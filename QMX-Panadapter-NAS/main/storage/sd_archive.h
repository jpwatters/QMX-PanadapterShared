// Background microSD auto-archive.
//
// If a FAT-formatted microSD card is present in the Tab5 slot, this module
// keeps an up-to-date mirror of the device's important files under
// /sdcard/qmx-panadapter/:
//   - qmx-log.txt   : the always-on diagnostic log (rotated at 5 MB to
//                     qmx-log.1.txt) — the off-chip persistence path, so a
//                     crash's log survives the reboot that follows it.
//   - qso.adi       : the ADIF QSO log (re-copied after each logged QSO)
//   - qmx-config.txt: the full config/settings export (re-written on change)
//
// The Tab5 routes no card-detect line to the SoC, so card presence is
// discovered by periodically attempting a mount; removal is detected when a
// file write starts failing. All work happens on a low-priority background
// task so it never competes with audio/FFT/FT8.

// SD-ARCHIVE SOFT-DISABLE (2026-07-09): the mounted card's SDMMC/SPI traffic
// shares one physical peripheral with the C6 WiFi co-processor's SDIO link
// (see CLAUDE.md "SD/WiFi shared-SDMMC wedge" - SPI mode was already a
// mitigation, not a cure; the residual wedge mechanism was never fully
// root-caused across several dedicated debugging sessions). Reproduced AGAIN
// 2026-07-09 during ordinary FT8 use, twice in one session, each time
// requiring a physical power-cycle to recover (no in-firmware recovery
// exists once it hits) - not an acceptable standing landmine, so this single
// flag is the entire on/off switch: sd_archive_init() early-returns and the
// background task is never spawned, so the card is never even mounted (same
// effect as not having a card in the slot at all). ADIF/config/diag-log data
// is unaffected - it all already lives in SPIFFS/NVS regardless; only the
// redundant SD-card copy is skipped. No code was deleted - flip this back to
// 0 to fully re-enable once the actual root cause is found and fixed. See
// memory project_sd_wedge_adif_repro_2026_07_09 for the specific repro this
// time (settings flush -> SD mirror -> wedge within ~12s, no SD-card-side
// error visible before the wedge signature appears).
//
// 2026-07-10: the WiFi *wedge* permanence was root-caused + fixed (the
// esp_hosted SDIO oversize-length livelock now self-heals — see
// tools/patches/apply_esp_hosted_sdio_recovery.ps1 and the SD-wedge section in
// CLAUDE.md), so the card was briefly re-enabled (flag=0). But a live test
// found a SEPARATE cost: with SD mounted, internal heap dropped to ~15 KB min /
// 16 KB largest-block (vs ~45 KB with SD off), and FT8 decode collapsed into
// zero-clusters on a busy band (cand=140, dec=0 — the internal-pinned decode
// FFT/buffers starve). So SD-on is a WiFi-safe now but FT8-hostile trade: kept
// DISABLED. Re-enabling would need the SD mount's internal-RAM cost reduced OR
// the mount gated off while in FT8 mode.
// 2026-07-19: RE-ENABLED (flag=0) for a fresh soak. The "SD mount starves FT8
// decode into cand=140/dec=0 zero-clusters" verdict above was reached BEFORE
// #51 was solved - and cand=140/dec=0 is the exact #51 signature (USB audio
// lost at the wire, NOT internal-heap starvation of the decode buffers). #51
// was root-caused + fixed 2026-07-19 (USB ISO pipeline depth 9 ms -> 320 ms),
// so the old blocker is very plausibly gone. Test: enable, mount a card, run
// FT8 on a busy band, read the existing per-slot log line - heap_i min/lblk
// (real, SD-independent cost) AND dec= (the #51 collapse tell). If yield holds
// (~16 uniq/slot) with SD mounted, SD is viable and this becomes a shipped
// feature; if it still collapses with healthy heap, the internal-RAM cost is a
// genuine separate issue (reduce mount footprint OR gate SD off in FT8 mode).

/* ⛔ PUT THE CARD DOWN BEFORE THE SoC RESETS.

 * Registered with esp_register_shutdown_handler(), so it runs on every reboot
 * the firmware itself initiates - an OTA, a settings or network reset, the
 * Reboot button - with the scheduler still up.
 *
 * It CANNOT cover esptool, which resets the chip from outside with no warning
 * (usb_shutdown.c's handler says the same about USB). That gap is what
 * {"action":"prepare_for_flash"} exists to close: ask for the teardown over
 * the network first, then reset the chip.
 *
 * ⚠ This is NOT about dirty data. Every write here is already
 * open/append/fflush/fsync/close per burst, so there is nothing buffered to
 * lose. It is about leaving the CARD idle: a card reset mid-transaction keeps
 * its own internal state across an SoC reset, and the Tab5 has no software
 * control of the card's power rail, so nothing can clear it afterwards -
 * measured on the bench 2026-10-03, where boot mounts needed 4, then 5, then
 * more than 5 attempts over successive reflashes until a full power-down. */
