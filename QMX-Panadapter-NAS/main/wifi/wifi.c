/* ---- static IP (Randy N4OPI) -------------------------------------------
 *
 * Empty `wifi_ip` means DHCP, which is what every existing unit has and what a
 * fresh one gets, so this cannot change anybody's network by being added.
 *
 * ⚠ THE ORDER IS NOT OBVIOUS AND IT IS LOAD-BEARING, established by reading
 * esp_netif_lwip.c rather than by trying combinations:
 *
 *  - `esp_netif_set_ip_info()` REFUSES with ESP_ERR_ESP_NETIF_DHCP_NOT_STOPPED
 *    while the DHCP client is anything but STOPPED. So the stop has to come
 *    first, and it has to come after the netif is started (that is where
 *    dhcpc_status exists to be stopped).
 *  - It also posts IP_EVENT_STA_GOT_IP itself - but ONLY when the lwIP netif is
 *    already UP. The netif comes up in esp_netif_action_connected(), i.e. on
 *    STA_CONNECTED. Setting the address any earlier stores it and posts
 *    nothing, and GOT_IP is what starts mDNS, SNTP and the web server here -
 *    so an early apply gives a device with an address and no services.
 *  - `esp_netif_set_ip_info()` calls dns_clear_servers() on a DHCP-client
 *    netif, so DNS must be set AFTER the address, never before.
 *
 * Hence: stop at STA_START, apply at STA_CONNECTED, DNS last.

 *   relink: esp_wifi_start failed: ESP_FAIL
 *
 * The rail is dropped while the SDIO transport is still up and still polling
 * the slave, so the driver spins on errors against hardware that is no longer
 * powered. The ordered teardown that would avoid it is esp_hosted_deinit(),
 * and that is ESP_ERROR_CHECK throughout - on a slave already believed dead
 * those abort the device, turning "WiFi is down" into "the device reboots",
 * which is strictly worse than the fault.
 *
 * ⭐ AND THE REASON IT EXISTED IS GONE. The link was dying because our own
 * SDIO drain advanced its byte counter past data it had never read - see
 * sdio_drv.c, fixed and measured 2026-10-03. The recovery was treating a
 * symptom of our own bug.
 *
 * So this now reports and stands down rather than acting. A restart genuinely

/* ⛔ NEVER esp_wifi_disconnect()+connect() INLINE FROM AN HTTP HANDLER.
 *
 * Randy N4OPI, 2026-09-27: repeatedly saw a settings save hang at
 * "Saving..." and never reach "Saved...", specifically whenever the save
 * also changed the network the unit is on. esp_wifi_disconnect() tears the
 * STA link down immediately - including the TCP connection the httpd worker
 * is using RIGHT NOW to send that same request's own "{"ok":true}" response.
 * The device-side save had completed; the browser just never heard about it,
 * because the link it was waiting on was the one just cut out from under it.
 *
 * This is not specific to the preferred-network path - panadapter_wifi_
 * reconnect() (used at webserver.c's "switch to a remembered network, no
 * password typed" case) had the exact same shape, and I only found it by
 * going looking after this same bug bit him a second time under a different
 * name. Both now route through this one deferred primitive, so a third
 * caller doing this inline cannot reintroduce it unnoticed.
 *
 * Runs the disconnect/reconnect ~500 ms later, off the caller's stack, so an
 * HTTP response has time to leave over the OLD link first - same reasoning
 * as factory_reset.c's reboot_task giving a response time to flush before
 * esp_restart() pulls the rug out. Harmless when the caller is the on-device
 * UI instead of the web UI (ui/wifi_config.c): a fifth of a second of extra
 * delay before a touch-driven network switch is not something a human
 * notices. */
