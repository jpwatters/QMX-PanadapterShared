 *
 * This side only stages the bytes; sd_archive.c owns every actual SD write,

 * the lock/pause discipline for it. A full buffer DROPS rather than blocking
 * the CAT poll task that feeds us - a missed transcript line is not worth a
 * stalled radio poll.
 *
 * ⚠ The transcript can only ever be as complete as the radio's own decoder:
 * the QMX's 40-character buffer is not circular and silently discards anything
 * that overflows it, so gaps are expected and the file must not be read as a
 * verbatim record of everything sent. The header written by sd_archive says so.
