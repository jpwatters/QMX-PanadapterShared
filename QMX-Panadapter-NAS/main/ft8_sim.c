// FT8 simulation mode - see ft8_sim.h for the full design rationale.
//
// A fixed pool of phantom stations periodically "call CQ" by synthesizing
// real GFSK audio for a real FT8 message and running it through the real
// on-device decode pipeline (ft8_synth_and_decode(), shared with
// ft8_arrl_fd_e2e_selftest()), then injecting the result into the normal
// decode list exactly as a genuine RX would. When the operator transmits
// (pounce, CQ-run answer, or any reply), this task detects it via
// ft8_tx_get_status() and schedules the phantom's next message on the
// correct opposite-parity slot, driven by ft8_qso_get_state() - the SAME
// state the real machine just moved itself into, so the reply content
// (grid/report/RR73/Field-Day class+section) always matches what the real
// exchange is actually waiting for. This module never reaches into
// ft8_qso.c's internals - it only ever feeds the same decode-list input a
// real signal would, so the QSO machine can't tell the difference.
//
// Safety: this module does NOT key the radio - that hard interlock lives in
// ft8_tx.c (ft8_tx_run()/ft8_tx_arm() check sim_mode_en directly and skip
// every cat_* call). This file only ever calls ft8_screen_record_decode().
