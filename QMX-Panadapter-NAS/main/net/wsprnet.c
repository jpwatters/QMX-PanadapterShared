/* wsprnet.org reception-report upload. See wsprnet.h for the rules this obeys
 * and why they are not negotiable.
 *
 * ---- THE WIRE FORMAT, AND HOW IT WAS ESTABLISHED ------------------------
 *
 * wsprnet's own upload documentation is not publicly readable (the pages 403,
 * and the API owner's note says to contact the custodian), so the PARAMETER
 * LIST comes from what WSJT-X and its forks send to http://wsprnet.org/post:
 *
 *   function=wspr &rcall &rgrid &rqrg &date &time &sig &dt &drift
 *                 &tqrg &tcall &tgrid &dbm &version &mode
 *
 * The VALUE formats are wsprd's own printed output, because that is literally
 * where WSJT-X takes them from - it parses its decoder's text and forwards the
 * fields. This repository carries real wsprd output on disk
 * (test/wav_reference/wspr/ *.txt), so every field below was checked against it
 * rather than assumed:
 *
 *     1910 -13 -0.4  14.097011  0  G8MCD IO91 23
 *     time  snr  dt   MHz     drift call  grid dbm
 *
 * ⚠ A summarised web fetch described `sig` as dBm. It is the SNR in dB - the
 * two are different fields and `dbm` is the separate transmit power. Checking
 * the line above is what caught it; this project has been bitten by trusting a
 * summarised fetch before (the ARRL FD bit layout had to be re-verified
 * against packjt77.f90 line by line).
 *
 * ⛔ AND THE ONE THAT WOULD HAVE POISONED EVERY SPOT WE EVER PUBLISHED:
 * wsprd reports the signal's CENTRE frequency, while wspr_decode_result_t
 * (and therefore wspr_spot_t.freq_hz) holds the TONE-0 frequency - 1.5 tone
 * spacings lower, 2.197265625 Hz. wspr_subtract.h documents the convention
 * difference because mixing the two up has cost this project before. Sending
 * our number straight out would have put EVERY spot 2.2 Hz low in a public
 * dataset, consistently, invisibly, and in a way nobody downstream could tell
 * from a real measurement.
