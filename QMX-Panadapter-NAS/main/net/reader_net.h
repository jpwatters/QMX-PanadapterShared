// The user manual is built into the firmware binary (see net/manual_embed.h), so
// a page view needs no WiFi, no SD card and no download, and can never show
// documentation for a different firmware version than the one running. This
// module just resolves a page from that blob into the SPIFFS render cache.
//
// Everything network- and SD-related that used to live here was removed once the
// manual moved into the binary - see the note at the top of reader_net.c for what
// went and why, so it does not come back.

// Load the manual's index page plus the contents list. Safe from the LVGL thread.

// load is already in flight. Safe from the LVGL thread.
