// ~10 fps. NOTE (2026-07-14): halving this to 5 fps was tried as a fix for a
// browser-stream stutter + a core-0-saturation reboot, on the theory that the
// WS TX path (httpd_ws_send_frame_async → LWIP/esp_hosted, core 0) dominated
// core 0. MEASURED WRONG: at 5 fps core-0 idle was unchanged (~12%). The real
// core-0 load is the audio→FFT→render→LVGL-rotation pipeline, which is active
// whenever the QMX streams audio (idle0 56%→12% coincides with USB-audio
// connect, NOT with a browser connecting). The WS rate is a minor contributor;
// reverted to 10 fps so the browser view isn't needlessly choppy. The core-0
// saturation (with core 1 ~94% idle) is the thing to fix — by rebalancing to
// core 1 / cutting the rotation cost — not here.
//
// ⚠ "NOT with a browser connecting" IS STALE, AND RX AUDIO IS WHY (2026-09-22).
// That was measured 2026-07-14, before Tab5-native RX audio existed, when core 0
// still had ~12% idle to give. With the radio streaming it now runs at 0.0-0.2%
// idle, so the browser is no longer a minor contributor - it is the last straw,
// and a page left open AUDIBLY BREAKS THE AUDIO. The operator A/B'd it on the
// bench (closing the browser: idle0 0.1% -> 2.9%, fps and invalidation
// unchanged), and Gyula HA3HZ had already told the groups.io list to close the
// page to get working audio. Do not re-derive "the browser doesn't matter" from

// ⛔ AN ADAPTIVE FRAME RATE WAS TRIED HERE AND REMOVED (#232, 2026-08-21). It
// raised the period when a frame needed more than one socket write and lowered
// it again when frames went cleanly. Recorded rather than forgotten, because it
// is an obvious idea to have twice:
//   * it NEVER ENGAGED - its own telemetry reported "target 10.0" throughout
//     the period the operator described the display as "very erratic".
//   * its premise was a WRONG NUMBER. It was built on a measured "~12.7 KB/s
//     link", of which 1026 B x 10 fps looked like 79%. That figure was taken
//     while the page was still uncompressed AND WiFi power save was still on.
//     Re-measured after both were fixed: six identical 86 KB fetches ran at min
//     9.9, median 32.5, max 74.7 KB/s. The stream is 13% of the good case, and
//     the 7.5x spread on IDENTICAL work says the link is LOSSY, not narrow.
//     Rate control cannot help a link that is dropping packets.
//   * its first form made things visibly worse, backing off x1.5 on a single
//     hard frame and swinging 10 fps -> 3 fps and back within seconds.
// Before reaching for this again, measure the SPREAD: a bandwidth ceiling gives
// consistent throughput, and this link does not.
/* ⭐ THE FRAME CARRIES THE STATE IT WAS CAPTURED WITH (#298 phase 5).

 * The viewport and the dial used to reach the browser only through /api/status
 * at 1 Hz, while frames arrive at 10. So for up to a second after the radio
 * moved, every frame was located with a stale dial: the spectrum slid by the
 * pending delta and - since each waterfall row carried a different stale value
 * - the history smeared into a diagonal. Two channels describing one instant
 * cannot be kept in step by hoping.
 *
 * byte[1] already worked this way for the payload layout, and the reasoning is
 * the same: a frame that describes itself cannot be raced by its own data.
 *
 * Header, little-endian:
 *   [0]      frame type
 *   [1]      zoom decimation (1 = raw base bins, >1 = fftshifted zoom FFT)
 *   [2..5]   dial Hz            - what the radio was on for THIS capture
 *   [6..9]   view_lo Hz         - left edge of what is drawn
 *   [10..13] span Hz
 *   [14..17] cap_lo Hz          - what the radio can hear
 *   [18..21] cap_hi Hz
 *   [22..23] if_offset Hz       - signed, fits comfortably in 16 bits

// ⛔ Do NOT go back to httpd_ws_send_frame_async() for the spectrum stream.
// Verified by reading the PINNED IDF v5.4.4 source
// (components/esp_http_server/src/httpd_ws.c), not inferred: it sends the header
// and the payload with two BARE calls to sess->send_fn() and checks only "< 0".
// httpd_default_send() is a single send() that RETURNS A BYTE COUNT, and a short
// count is not negative - so a PARTIAL TCP WRITE IS REPORTED TO US AS ESP_OK.
// The ordinary HTTP path does not have this bug: it uses httpd_send_all(), which
// loops until the buffer is drained. The WS path simply never got that loop.
//
// This bites here harder than it would anywhere else, because ws_uri_handler()
// deliberately sets SO_SNDTIMEO to 400 ms (so a stuck send cannot freeze the
// single httpd worker - the 2026-07-14 fix). A send timeout on a socket that has
// already queued some bytes is EXACTLY how a short count arises, so on a
// congested link the partial write is not a rare edge case, it is the expected
// outcome. The freeze fix and this bug are the same line of code.
//
// The consequence is not a dropped frame, it is a CORRUPT STREAM. The browser has
// been told to expect WS_FRAME_LEN payload bytes; it gets fewer, so it consumes
// the NEXT frame's header as the tail of this one and every frame afterwards is
// misparsed. The browser then sees a protocol violation and closes the socket -
// which is why the symptom is "the panadapter freezes for a few seconds and then
// comes back", not "one glitchy frame".

//     8.6x, TLS handshake 5.7x, SDIO recovery 4.6x, against an 8.1 % base rate

         *
         *  - The browser then had to know the rotation to locate anything, and
         *    it did not - it assumed dial-at-centre and derived its own pan from
         *    the BIN-ROUNDED pan_bins. When the page was moved onto the device's
         *    real viewport the two orderings disagreed by 256 bins, which folded
         *    to 768 and showed up on the bench as the spectrum sitting exactly
         *    36 kHz low.
         *
         *  - The `% N` WRAPPED. The rotated payload spans dial +/-24 kHz, but the
         *    radio hears dial-36k..dial+12k, so the top 12 kHz of every frame was
         *    somebody else's spectrum and the bottom 12 kHz of real signal was
         *    never sent anywhere recoverable. That is #297, alive in the wire
         *    format long after the Tab5 stopped doing it.
         *
         * Sending raw bins lets the browser run the SAME mapping the Tab5 does -
         * viewBinAt() mirrors pan_view_x_to_bin() - so both screens locate a
         * signal identically and the browser can reach the whole capture window.
         *
         * ⚠ This is a WIRE FORMAT CHANGE. It is safe because the page is served
         * BY the device, so the two can never be out of step; but a browser tab
         * left open across a firmware update must be reloaded, and byte[1] is
         * not enough to tell it so.
         *
         * ⛔ The ZOOM path still fftshifts. dsp_set_zoom() has already mixed the
         * target to DC, pan_view deliberately does not describe it, and the
         * browser keeps its old centre-based path there. Do not "make it
