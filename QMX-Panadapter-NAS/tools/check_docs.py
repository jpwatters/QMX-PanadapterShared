"""Documentation consistency checks, run from the mkdocs hook on every docs build.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
On 2026-08-09, the evening v1.7.0 shipped, a read-through of the PDF turned up a
version marker that looked stale. Chasing it found considerably more:

  * Three flatly WRONG instructions, one of them dangerous - the build guide told
    a reader whose device would not boot to flash the app to 0x0, which is where
    the bootloader lives and is exactly how units were bricked in v0.18.5.
  * The panadapter guide described a snap grid that varied with ZOOM (10 kHz at
    x1); it is and was mode-aware (10 Hz CW ... 1 kHz AM). It also called the x1
    span "4 MHz" - it is 48 kHz - and documented an S-meter peak-hold mode that
    has never existed.
  * FOURTEEN occurrences of "new in the next release", written during v1.6.0
    development and never updated when v1.6.0 shipped. They were live on the
    website, in the PDF, and compiled into the on-device manual.
  * Whole features - Bluetooth mouse, activation logging, SWR protection - were
    documented on the website but absent from the printable guide.

None of it was anyone's decision. It is what happens when the same thing is
described in two trees and only one of them gets read. These checks are the
cheap mechanical part of not repeating it; judgement is still human.

The checks
----------
1. FORWARD-LOOKING TEXT (error). "new in the next release" is true exactly until
   the release, and nothing makes it false again. Ban the phrasing outright.
2. PDF COVERAGE (warning). Every page in the mkdocs nav should reach the
   printable guide somehow - either the PDF builder injects it, or README has a
   section of its own on the subject. A page in neither is invisible to anyone
   reading the PDF.
3. BROKEN PDF LINKS (error). The user-guide PDF is versioned in its filename and
   the builder deletes every older one, so any link that spells out a version
   dies at the next release. Found 2026-10-05: docs/mkdocs/releases.md still
   pointed at v1.16.9 four releases on - a 404 on the site's "User Guide PDF"
   button. build_userguide_pdf.ps1 now rewrites those links itself; this check
   is the net under a hand-edit.
4. DUPLICATE COVERAGE (warning). Headings that exist in BOTH README and the
   mkdocs tree are the drift surface: two texts, one topic, and no mechanism
   keeping them honest with each other. Fewer is better.
