.SYNOPSIS
    Makes FatFs allocate its sector buffers DMA-alignment-clean, so SD reads
    stop allocating a 512 B DMA bounce buffer per sector.

.DESCRIPTION
    MEASURED 2026-10-04 in Randy N4OPI's diag (qmx-diag-20261003-1637.zip),
    t=4133 s, on v1.16.11:

        E sdmmc_cmd: sdmmc_read_sectors_dma: ... returned 0x101
        E diskio_sdmmc: sdmmc_read_blocks failed (0x101)
        E heapwatch: ALLOC FAILED: 512 B caps=0x00000008 in task 'httpd'
        W httpd_txrx: httpd_resp_send_err: 404 Not Found - not found

    0x101 is ESP_ERR_NO_MEM. caps=0x8 is MALLOC_CAP_DMA. The web file browser
    returned "file not found" for a file that was on the card, because the
    stat() behind it could not get 512 bytes of DMA memory.

    MECHANISM

    sdmmc_read_sectors() (IDF components/sdmmc/sdmmc_cmd.c) checks the caller's
    buffer with esp_dma_is_buffer_alignment_satisfied(). If the buffer passes,
    the read goes straight to DMA. If it does not, the driver falls back to a
    per-call heap_caps_malloc of one sector with MALLOC_CAP_DMA, reads one
    sector at a time into it, and memcpy's out. That malloc is the 512 B
    allocation above, and it fails whenever the DMA pool is low - which on this
    board it always eventually is.

    The required alignment is lcm(dma_alignment, cacheline):
      - sdmmc_host_get_dma_info() reports dma_alignment_bytes = 4
      - this project sets CONFIG_CACHE_L2_CACHE_LINE_SIZE=128 (PSRAM, L2)
        and CONFIG_CACHE_L1_CACHE_LINE_SIZE=64 (internal, L1)
    so a PSRAM buffer needs 128-byte alignment and an internal one needs 64.

    FatFs allocates its own sector window (fs->win, ff.c:3445) and, with
    CONFIG_FATFS_PER_FILE_CACHE=y, a per-file cache (fp->buf, ff.c:3885)
    through ff_memalloc(). With CONFIG_FATFS_ALLOC_PREFER_EXTRAM=y those land
    in PSRAM via heap_caps_malloc_prefer(), which guarantees no alignment past
    the malloc minimum. So every FatFs metadata read - stat, readdir, opendir,
    f_open, the FAT itself - took the bounce path and needed a 512 B DMA
    allocation it could not always get.

    THE FIX

    Allocate through heap_caps_aligned_alloc() at 128 bytes, with the size
    rounded up to the same boundary, keeping the existing PSRAM-then-internal
    preference. 128 covers both cache levels, so the buffer is clean wherever
    it lands. ff_memfree() still uses free(), which is correct for
    heap_caps_aligned_alloc (heap_caps_aligned_free is a deprecated alias for
    heap_caps_free).

    ⛔ THIS PATCH DOES NOTHING ON ITS OWN. FatFs declares the window as
    `BYTE win[FF_MAX_SS]` INSIDE the FATFS struct unless FF_USE_DYN_BUFFER is
    set, and an inline array sits at a fixed OFFSET - measured on the bench
    2026-10-04, aligning the allocation still left the window at 0x491e58e0,
    96 bytes past a 128 boundary, and every read still bounced.
    CONFIG_FATFS_USE_DYN_BUFFERS=y in sdkconfig.defaults is the other half: it
    makes win and buf separate ff_memalloc() allocations, which this patch then
    aligns. Neither works without the other.

    This does NOT cover buffers the application passes to fread/fwrite - those
    are aligned at their own call sites in main/.

    Cost: at most 127 bytes of slack per FatFs allocation, in PSRAM.

    Because this edits the pinned IDF install (NOT the project tree), it is
    wiped if the IDF is reinstalled and must be re-applied per build machine -
    same maintenance model as tools/patches/apply_fatfs_exfat.ps1.

    Idempotent: running it twice is a no-op.
