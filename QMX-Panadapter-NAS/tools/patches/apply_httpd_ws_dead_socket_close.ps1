# Standing patch #9 - httpd must CLOSE a websocket whose socket is dead, not
# merely mark it and spin on it.
#
# THE BUG, measured in Roy KI0ER's diagnostic log 2026-08-19 (#203/#59):
#
#   19,773 x "httpd_txrx: httpd_sock_err: error in recv : 128" (ENOTCONN) at a
#   steady 158/s, spanning 125.7 seconds. During that window FT8 decoded
#   NOTHING for 117 s, the audio ring overflowed (DROPPED=49936, ring full)
#   while the QMX kept delivering 49k pairs/s, and both occupancy strips went
#   grey. The operator reported it as "the offset strips went grey for no
#   reason".
#
# WHY IT STARVES EVERYTHING: the httpd worker runs at priority 5. fft_task -
#   the audio ring's ONLY consumer - is priority 4, ws_push is 3, the spot and
#   PSK feeds are 2. A worker spinning flat out at 5 denies the core to every
#   one of them, so nothing below it can even run to clean the socket up. In
#   Roy's log the dead fd was finally closed only when a NEW browser connected
#   125 s later and our own takeover logic closed the stale one.
#
# THE CAUSE: httpd_ws_get_frame_type() cannot read the header byte from a
#   half-closed socket, and its own comment says "closing socket now" - but it
#   returns ESP_OK. httpd_req_new() then marks sd->ws_close and returns ESP_OK
#   too, so httpd_sess_process() succeeds and httpd_main.c NEVER reaches its
#   httpd_sess_delete(). The socket stays readable forever, select keeps
#   firing, and the recv is retried every ~6 ms until something external
#   intervenes.
#
# THE FIX: return ESP_FAIL instead. httpd_main.c already does the right thing
#   with it:
#       if (httpd_sess_process(ctx->hd, session) != ESP_OK) {
#           httpd_sess_delete(ctx->hd, session);
#       }
#   so one changed return value turns an endless spin into the close the
#   function's own comment always claimed to be doing.
#
# ⚠ Edits the PINNED IDF INSTALL TREE, so an IDF reinstall wipes it and it must
#   be re-applied per build machine - same model as patches #4, #5, #7 and #8.
#   tools/check_patches.py fails the build without it.
