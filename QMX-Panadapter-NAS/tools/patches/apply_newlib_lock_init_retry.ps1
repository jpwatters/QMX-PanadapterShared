# Standing patch - newlib's port, components/newlib/locks.c, lock_init_generic().
#
# WHY
# ---
# Every task's FIRST use of a given C-library facility that needs a lock
# (malloc's own arena lock, stdio, etc.) lazily creates the mutex here, and
# on failure the stock code aborts unconditionally: `if (!new_sem) abort();`
# - "No more semaphores available or OOM". CLAUDE.md already documents one
# occurrence of this exact class (#317, root-caused to leftover R&D code
# that called fopen() 140x/slot) but its own general diagnosis stands:
# "ANY task's first [lock-needing call] while internal heap is near zero
# can abort the device - there is nothing special about [any one caller]."
#
# Reproduced twice more on hardware 2026-09-20, DIFFERENT tasks each time -
# `diag_persist` and `spots` - both aborting here during the same boot-time
# internal-RAM trough this board has extensive history with. Neither task
# does anything unusual; they just happened to be the ones taking their
# first lock-needing call at the wrong moment.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES
# --------------
# Restructures the single attempt into a bounded retry loop: on failure,
# leave the critical section (a mutex allocation can take tens of ms even
# when it succeeds, and this board's own measurements put the boot trough
# at tens of ms to a few seconds - never hold a spinlock across a wait),
# pause briefly, and try again - re-checking *lock first each time, in case
# a racing thread initialised it while this one was waiting. Still aborts
# after 100 attempts (~2 s), preserving the original behaviour for genuine,
# sustained exhaustion.
#
# 2026-09-26: THE BUDGET WAS 5 ATTEMPTS (~100 ms) AND THAT WAS TOO SHORT.
# It was chosen before anyone had measured how long the trough lasts. A 50 Hz
# sampler (main/util/heap_watch.c) measured the real events on a SHIPPING
# build: internal free reaches 143-191 B for 60, 100, 121 and 361 ms, about
# 24 times a minute, at steady state and not only at boot. So the retry
# expired INSIDE a single ordinary dip and aborted - `sd_archive` at 641 s on
# 2026-09-25 and again at 401 s on 2026-09-26, both decoding to
# lock_init_generic at locks.c:80. 2 s covers the measured worst case with
# more than 5x margin. The dips themselves are a separate, still-open fault;
# this only stops them from being fatal.
#
# Edits the pinned IDF tree, so an IDF reinstall wipes it - per-build-machine,
# like the other IDF-tree patches. Idempotent, marker-guarded.
