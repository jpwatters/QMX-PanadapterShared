# bench.ps1 - one front door for a bench with four boards on it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Four ESP32-P4 boards share this machine and all four enumerate as the same
#   VID_303A&PID_1001, so nothing in the USB descriptor tells them apart. The
#   COM number follows the SOCKET, not the board. That has already cost one
#   board: it took a Tab5 binary at 94% and boot-looped, because VID_303A was
#   read as "must be the Tab5".
#   So: every port here comes from tools/bench.json by bench NAME, never from
#   auto-detection, and a flash is verified afterwards against the MAC the
#   firmware prints in its own boot header.
#
#   The CPU is 2 cores. One build saturates it; two thrash and starve whatever
#   else is running. The lock is not politeness, it is the scheduler.
#
# USAGE
#   bench list                 what exists, what is plugged in, what is running
#   bench status <name>        ask the running firmware over the network
#   bench capture <name>       start the standing serial capture (leave it up)
#   bench stopcapture <name>   the only legitimate reason is a flash
#   bench standdown <name>     "release COMx and stand down": kill + keep the watchdog off it
#                              until `bench capture <name>` (alias: bench release)
#   bench watchdog [off|status]  keep captures alive (every minute); see bench_watchdog.ps1
#   bench build [<name>]       build that bench's tree, under the lock
#   bench flash <name>         lock, stop capture, flash, restart capture, verify
#   bench verify <name>        re-check the MAC in the latest boot header
#   bench antenna [<name>]     show / record which bench is on the antenna
#   bench lock | unlock | who  manual lock control
#
# Usable from any worktree: it reads the registry by absolute path.

    # `(Get-CaptureProcess ...).Count` was $null.

    # That is not a cosmetic bug. Cmd-Flash asked `.Count -gt 0` to decide

    # `bench flash` after `bench standdown` died on it. It only LOOKED fixed
    # because member enumeration makes `$nested.ProcessId` return the real PID
    # when there is at least one element.
