/* Host test for wspr_wav_header() / wspr_wav_filename().
 *
 * Build (from the repo root):
 *   gcc -I main -o wspr_wav_harness test/wspr_wav_harness.c main/wspr_wav.c \
 *       && ./wspr_wav_harness
 *
 * Why this exists: the WSPR capture dump writes a 2.88 MB WAV to the SD card so
 * the same window can be run through real wsprd on a PC - the only way to tell
 * "our sensitivity is short" from "those traces are not WSPR". If the header is
 * wrong the file is silently useless: wsprd either refuses it or reads the
 * wrong length, and either way the answer we went to the trouble of collecting
 * is garbage. None of that is worth discovering after an hour of captures.
 *
 * ⭐ THE STRONGEST TEST HERE IS AN EXTERNAL VECTOR. test/wav_reference/ holds
 * WSJT-X's own recordings, whose headers were written by somebody else's code.
 * Byte-comparing against those checks our layout against something other than
 * our own reasoning - the same reason the LoTW harness uses CardSat's worked
 * example rather than only self-consistent cases.
 *
 * It links the REAL functions, not copies.
